            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>J. O.</hi> Publiſhed ſome Years ſince, <hi>A Plea for Scripture-Ordination,</hi> Proving by Scripture and Antiquity, That Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Presbyters, without Biſhops, is Valid.</p>
            <p>Several Hands were ſaid to be at Work, preparing Remarks upon it; at length, after near Three Years Silence, comes forth a ſort of Anſwer, by one Mr. <hi>T. G. Rector</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> an Author well known in his Countrey, by ſome <hi>Prerogative Sermons,</hi> which he Printed ſome Years ſince.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> He Fronts his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book with a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Title, and calls it <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> that is, <hi>A new Tryal of Skill.</hi> Here is an implicit Confeſſion of a baffled Cauſe; he dare not truſt to the <hi>Old Arguments</hi> for Epiſcopacy, but is glad to betake himſelf to <hi>New Shifts.</hi> It's a deſperate Cauſe that needs <hi>new Arts</hi> to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>The plain Engliſh of <hi>Tentamen Novum</hi> is this: <hi>Gentlemen, I am very ſenſible the
<pb facs="tcp:59622:3"/>Cauſe I Plead for cannot ſtand on its old Foundations; therefore I will make a</hi> New Effort, <hi>and</hi> try, <hi>Whether the lofty Fabrick of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy may not be Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on the Slender and Nice Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a new Point of Chronology. If this fails, the Cauſe is loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, his Title looks a little Modeſt, but a <hi>Man of Aſſurance</hi> cannot be long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd under a Vizard, for in the very next Words he calls his Argument a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For thus his Title-Page runs; <hi>Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Novum, Proving that</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were Dioceſan Rulers, by an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn frhm the time of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s beſeeching</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and leaving</hi> Titus <hi>at</hi> Crete, <hi>as it is demonſtrated by Biſhop</hi> Pearſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Doubtful Attempt,</hi> and a <hi>Conſident Demonſtration,</hi> are ſomething inconſiſtent. But I have been ſo kind to him as to Reconcile the <hi>Title-Page</hi> to the <hi>Title</hi> of his Book, by proving his Suppoſed <hi>Demonſtration</hi> to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> a <hi>new</hi> and fruitleſs <hi>Attempt,</hi> to defend an <hi>Un-ſcriptural Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.</hi> This the Reader way find in the Third and Fourth Chapter of this Book.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> I deſire the Reader to obſerve, That there is but one Chapter <hi>(Chap. V.)</hi> in the Rector's Book, which he calls an Anſwer to <hi>J. O</hi>'s <hi>Plea,</hi> and in that he briefly touches upon Two or Three of <hi>Ten Arguments,</hi> which <hi>J.
<pb facs="tcp:59622:3"/>O.</hi> has urged for Ordination by Presbyters. This is <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> a new way of Anſwering Books. He pretends to Anſwer <hi>J. O</hi>'s <hi>Plea for Scripture-Ordination,</hi> which is the Running-Title of the whole Book, and ſo would perſuade his <hi>Reader</hi> that he has An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the whole.</p>
            <p>I will not impeach his Candour in this Form of Speech, which ſhews his Skill in a Rhetorical Figure, that Subſtitutes a Part for the whole: As if a vain-glorious Captain, who had At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd a Company or two, ſhould ſay by a <hi>Romantick Syneedoche,</hi> he had beaten an Army.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> The Deſign of his Book is to prove, That meer Presbyters have no Inherent Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and that all Ordinations by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are a Nullity. This Notion is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and I hope has but few Patrons in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> It <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-churches all the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, who have no Biſhops of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Species, and by this Gentleman's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, no Miniſtry, no Sacraments, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Salvation. He owns a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in the Popiſh Church, and overthrows the Miniſtry of the Reformed Churches. His Neighbours of the <hi>Romiſh Communion</hi> are obliged to conn him Thanks for the Service he would have done to their Cauſe againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt. To ſay, <hi>Theirs is a Caſe of Neceſſity, but ſo is not ours,</hi> is to triſte,
<pb facs="tcp:59622:4"/>as <hi>J. O.</hi> hath prov'd in his Book, but Mr. <hi>G.</hi> wiſely paſſed over that Chapter, as if it were not there.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> This uncharitable Hypotheſis contradicts the Moderate and Learned Defenders of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, who generally grant the Validity of Ordination by Presbyters, though they judge it irregular where Biſhops may be had.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> allows the Ordination of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters alone, on this Principle, That the Church can give them Power, for according to him all Power is originally in the whole Body. <hi>Eccl. Polit. VII. p. 37, 38.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> grants, That <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, in caſe of neceſſity, Presbyters may ordain</hi> without Biſhops, and gives this Reaſon for the Validity of their Ordination; becauſe Impoſition of Hands in Confirmation, and Reconciliation of Penitents, were reſerv'd to Biſhops, as well as Ordination, and yet in the abſence of Biſhops may be done by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Def. of his Conſ. Serm. III. 3. P. 69, 108.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forbes</hi> acknowledges, That <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Presbyters have the Power of Ordaining, as well as of I reaching and Baptizing, though they muſt uſe it under the Biſhop's Inſpection, in thoſe places that have Biſhops. <hi>Iren. p. 164.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame was the Judgment of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher.</hi> See his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Reduct.</hi> by Dr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>De Rep. Eccleſ.</hi> in ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:59622:4"/>places. He ſaith, <hi>That the Presbyterial Order hath always the Keys annexed, and that when any is Ordain'd Presbyter, the Keys are given him, and Juriſdiction with Orders, by Divine Right.</hi> Lib. <hi>V.</hi> Cap. <hi>12.</hi> p. <hi>473.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> This Hypotheſis condemns the very Church of <hi>England,</hi> who in her Articles (Compoſed by the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and the Clergy in Convocation, and Confirm'd by Parliament, <hi>13. Eliz. 12.</hi>) allows the Ordinations of the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, which are by Presbyters.</p>
            <p>Art. <hi>23. Thoſe we ought to Judge law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Call'd and Sent, which be choſen and call'd to this Work by Men who have Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and ſend Miniſters into the Lord's Vineyard</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Rog. in Prop. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The Article doth not ſay, <hi>None are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call'd but by Biſhops,</hi> but that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought to be <hi>Call'd by Men who have publick Authority given unto them in the Congregation,</hi> which Ordaining Presbyters may have, and actually have in the <hi>Foreign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Congregations</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> acknowledged Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations by Presbyters, and look'd upon Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Biſhops to be but <hi>a prudential Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> as <hi>J. O.</hi> hath prov'd at large in his Book, <hi>Cap. IX</hi> which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> alſo prudently overlooks. We may
<pb facs="tcp:59622:5"/>preſume he hath <hi>good Reaſon</hi> for his <hi>Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ordinations of Foreign Churches were not Queſtion'd here before Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s time. My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> complains of it, as a new thing, and uncommon in his days. <hi>Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Perſons,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have been told</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy began to be urged about that time, to the great Joy and Advantage of the Popiſh Party, as appears by a Letter to a Popiſh Peer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>T.

               <pb facs="tcp:59622:5"/>This Letter was found, with other Papers, at the taking of <hi>Droghedah,</hi> after the Rout of <hi>Remines. Copia vera ab Origin. ut fuit cum Hen. Midenſ. Epiſcopo.</hi>

            <p>The Book which <hi>White</hi> refers to, is Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, which was alter'd, and put into the Form in which we now have it, by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s firſt Draught, call'd, <hi>Epiſcopacy an Ancient, Holy, and Divine Inſtitution,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop directed him to alter it into, <hi>So An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, as that it is of Divine Inſtitution. Hall <hi>defined Epiſcopacy,</hi> by being joyn'd with Imparity and Superiority of Juriſdiction, Laud</hi> directs him to define it by <hi>a diſtinction of Orden. Hall</hi> grants that the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Government may be of uſe where Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy may not be had. Laud</hi> tells him <hi>this is of dangerous Conſequence,</hi> and that we muſt not uſe any <hi>mincing Terms,</hi> nor hamper our ſelves for fear of ſpeaking plain Truth, though it be againſt <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> found good Cauſe (ſaith my Author<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Heyl. Life of A. Biſh. Laud, <hi>p. 400, 401, 402.</hi>
               </note>) to Correct the Obliquity of his Opinion, according to the Rules of theſe Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Book being finiſhed, the Arch-Biſhop read it over with care and diligence. In the peruſal of which, he took notice amongſt other things, That the ſtrict Superſtition of the <hi>Sabbatarians,</hi> was but lightly touch'd at;
<pb facs="tcp:59622:6"/>whereas he thought, that ſome ſmarter Plaiſter to that Sore might have done no harm. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo, that he had paſſed by this Point, <hi>viz. Whether Epiſcopacy be an Order or a Degree,</hi> as not material: Whereas, in the Judgment of ſuch Learned Men as he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, it was the main ground of the whole Cauſe, and therefore deſir'd him to alter it with his own Pen. But that which gave him moſt offence was, That the Title of Antichriſt was poſitively and determinately beſtowed on the Pope, which he allow'd not of.</p>
            <p>According to which good advice, ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> qualified ſome of his Expreſſions, and deleted others. <hi>ubi ſupr. p. 406.</hi> It is remarkable, that at the ſame time that the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Epiſcopacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be aſſerted here, the Divine Right of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi> was call'd in queſtion, and the Conſciencious Obſervers of it were branded with the odious Name of <hi>Sabbatarians.</hi> At the ſame time alſo, the old Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England, That the Pope is Anti-Chriſt,</hi> began to be out of requeſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> This Hypotheſis condemns the late Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which admitted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Presbyters to be valid, as Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Sarum</hi> affirms. Thus he: <hi>The Biſhops of</hi> Scotland <hi>never required the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters there to take Epiſcopal Ordination; they required them only to come and act with them in Church-Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories.

            <p>The advancing of an Hypotheſis ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, ſo deſtructive to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches abroad, ſo inconſiſtent with the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath ſubſcribed) and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Practice of the Scottiſh Biſhops, and the repeated Declarations of ſeveral of our Engliſh Biſhops, may tempt Perſons to ſuſpect the deſign of the Book, if not of the Author. But we will charitably hope he meant well, and in a tranſport of Zeal, which excludes freedom of thought, might eaſily over-look the fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of his indigeſted Principles.</p>

               <hi>IV.</hi> He tells us a long Story in his Preface of the occaſion of his publiſhing of his Book, <hi>p. 1.</hi> and <hi>2.</hi> and complains <hi>that his Sermon of the Conſecration and Holineſs of Churches</hi> has not been Anſwered by the Diſſenters, <hi>and,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is good reaſon for it, which I ſhall not here repeat.</hi> To <hi>repeat</hi> a thing not mentioned before is a little improper. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs there is <hi>good Reaſon</hi> why that Sermon has not been anſwered, and that is, <hi>his not Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it;</hi> let him Publiſh it, and he ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:59622:7"/>long complain, <hi>That that Controverſie is dropt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am a Stranger to that Sermon, but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he ſhould prove <hi>the Conſecration and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Churches</hi> by the Scripture, for he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>(Pref. p. 13.) That we ought to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Scripture, and to keep cloſe to Scripture-practice.</hi> I am ſure he cannot prove it from the New Teſtament, which is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Law of Chriſt, and the Rule of Chriſtians. It doth not appear, that Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, ever Conſecrated any Places of Worſhip. Nor can he prove it from the Old Teſtament. By the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> (which in the main Branches of it was more Ancient than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Jewiſh Temple) our publick Churches are ſo far from being <hi>holy,</hi> that they are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> becauſe the Dead are buried there. He that touched a <hi>Grave</hi> was unclean by the old <hi>Law, Num. 19.16.</hi> The Jews buried their Dead not in their Temple, or Synagogues, but in places appropriated to that uſe, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unclean.

            <p>Their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> which anſwer to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Churches, were not Conſecrated as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was: nor was there any Law for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of them, nor of their <hi>Divinity-Schools,</hi> which they judged more Holy than their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues<note n="‖" place="margin">Maim. in Godw.

            <p>In imitation of them the Chriſtians, as they degenerated from the Apoſtolical Simplicity, built Temples in honour of departed Saints and Martyrs. They call'd their Temples after their Names, Dedicated them to ſuch and ſuch Saints, in Memory of which they kept <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> which gave occaſion to our <hi>Wakes.</hi> We have ſome Inſtances of theſe Dedications and Feſtivals in the Fourth Century. <hi>Euſeb.

            </p>
            <p>No Inſtance can be given of any <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Temples</hi> till about <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, and the Dedications of that Age were no <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Conſecrations;</hi> they were only cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with Solemn Prayers, Praiſes, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Adminiſtring the Euchariſt, which are the ſtated Duties to be performed in ſuch places. The firſt performance of theſe Religious Duties can have no more Vertue for Conſecration of the
<pb facs="tcp:59622:8"/>Place, than the continued Series of them. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> mentions alſo ſome Orations in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Benefactor, and the Magnificen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Structure, which were delivered at thoſe Solemnities<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Ceremonious Conſecrations <hi>appropriated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Biſhops,</hi> were unknown in the three firſt Centuries.</p>
            <p>I find but one Inſtance of it in the Fourth Century, and that in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in which Superſtitions grew faſter than in other Churches, and this inſtance is very dubious. The <hi>Roman</hi> Council under <hi>Sylveſter</hi> is ſaid to Decree, <hi>That no Presbyter preſume to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate Maſs, but in Places Conſecrated by the Biſhop</hi>

            <p>The Acts of this Council are juſtly ſuſpected to be Spurious, for certain the Twentieth Canon, which forbids <hi>Judging the firſt Seat</hi> is ſo. <hi>Vid. Conc. Nicen. Can. 6..</hi>

            <p>About the Year <hi>494.</hi> the Power of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating Churches, which the Biſhops had before appropriated to themſelves, was reſtrained to Metropolitans by Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi>

            <p>We conceive that all places are equally near to Heaven, and that all Places where the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is Celebrated, are equally Holy.

            <p>Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tells us, that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> had a deſign to draw up an <hi>Engliſh Pontifical,</hi> to be approv'd by the Convocation, in the Year <hi>1640.</hi> This new <hi>Pontifical</hi> was to contain, among other things, a Form to be obſerved by all Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, for Conſecrating Churches, Church-Yards, and Chapels<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Laud</hi>'s. Life, p. 441.</note>. But the Troubles of the Time obliged him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the proſecution of it till a fitter conjuncture. When King <hi>Charles II.</hi> returned, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had all the advantage they could deſire, they did not proſecute the deſign, not being ſo violent in that Point, as <hi>Laud</hi> and his Party had been.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Wherein doth a <hi>Conſecration</hi> promote the acceptance of our Devotions with. God?

If it be not, what are we the better for Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If it be, let the Rector prove it. Can he ſhew any Promiſe that is made to Conſecrated Places as ſuch, under the Goſpel? He cannot produce either a Command of Precedent for Conſecration of Places under the Goſpel, nor a Promiſe to ſuch Places above others.

            </p>

            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> But to return to the main Subject. Our Author would ſay ſomething, if he knew what, for the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, but his Diſcourſe is ſo cloudy, confuſed, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſten, that it is hard to imagine what he drives at in ſeveral places.</p>
            <p>His Book conſiſts of Five Chapters.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In the firſt Chapter he endeavours to prove that none but Apoſtles and Prophets did Ordain. Suppoſe this were granted him, which I have prov'd to be falſe, I cannot ſee what advantage he can make of it; for Biſhops are neither Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles nor Prophets. He himſelf makes 'em <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> which are different from Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Eph. 4.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> In the ſecond Chapter he would prove, That St. <hi>Paul,</hi> towards the declining part of his Life, made <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi> In Anſwer to which, I have fully prov'd, from <hi>acts 20.</hi> That the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and by undeniable conſequence of all other Churches, was committed to the Presbyters in Parity, and not to one Supreme Preſident.</p>
            <p>I have evidenced this Government to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Perpetual, and an apt Remedy againſt Schiſm. I have ſhew'd that it was ſettled by
<pb facs="tcp:59622:10"/>the Apoſtle, when he could Over-ſee that Church no more, and had no proſpect of ever ſeeing it again.</p>
            <p>It's pretended by the late Aſſerters of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, <hi>That the Apoſtles when they took their laſt leave of the Churches, ſettled Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for their Succeſſors to preſide over the Presbyters, as a Remedy againſt: the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schiſms.</hi> I have demonſtrated from the 20th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> That it is quite otherwiſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> left the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> as his <hi>ordinary Succeſſors</hi> in the. Government of that Church, and that in proſpect of <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and of his <hi>final departure</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>The evidence of this Eſtabliſhment is ſo bright and convincing, that our Author cannot but acknowledge it, <hi>p. 47.</hi> and the poor ſhifts which he uſeth there to avoid the force of this unanſwerable Argument, ſhews the power of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Temptation upon ſelf-convicted minds.</p>
            <p>The Proofs for <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> depends upon a nice Point of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which at beſt is doubtful, and amounts to no more than a probability, and is not capable of a Demonſtration. This leaves the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Epiſcopacy doubtful and uncertain.</p>
            <p>But our Proof that the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was ſettled in the Elders of that Church, is grounded upon plain matter of Fact, that cannot he deny'd.</p>
            <p>It's certain that the Apoſtle had no proſpect of ſeeing the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Elders any more, when he
<pb facs="tcp:59622:11"/>committed the Government of that Church to them, <hi>Acts 20.25, 28.</hi> and therefore the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Epheſus ſucceeded</hi> the Apoſtle in the Government of that Church.</p>
            <p>But it is not certain that the Apoſtle made <hi>Timothy</hi> Supream Governour of that Church afterwards. Moſt Chronologers, the Defenders of Epiſcopacy not excepted, are of Opinion, That the Firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written before the Congreſs at <hi>Miletus,</hi> mention'd in <hi>Acts 20.17.</hi> whence it naturally follows, that his Charge in <hi>Epheſus</hi> was occaſional and temporary, as an <hi>unfixed Evangeliſt, 2 Tim. 4.5.</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Church was left in the Elders of it, <hi>Acts 20.17, 28.</hi> as the Supream and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Governours of it after the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemeth no ſmall diſparagement to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan</hi> Cauſe, that the grand Patrons of it ſo extreamly differ among themſelves, and cannot agree about the Foundations of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers, Jeſuits and others, do generally affirm, That Biſhops were ſettled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Apoſtles in all Churches, and that though the Names of Biſhops and Presbyters were common, the Offices were diſtinct.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers confeſs, That God hath preſcribed no one Form of Church-Government in the New Teſtament, ſo <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's Iren.</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccl. Polit. Lib. III.</hi> and if no Form be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore not the Prelatical.</p>
            <p>Others, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:59622:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>That the Presbyters mention'd in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, were Biſhops in a proper Senſe, thus <hi>Petavius</hi> and <hi>Hammond,</hi> but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; <hi>Petavius</hi> thinks <hi>there were many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in one Church,</hi> as in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and that the ſimple manners of the Church would then bear this, till Ambition had corrupted Men. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> conceives there was but <hi>one Biſhop in one Church.</hi> This Notion of Biſhops without Subject Elders was begun by <hi>Scotus,</hi> as <hi>Fr. a Sancta Clara</hi> intimateth.</p>
            <p>Some late Writers acknowledge, That Biſhops and Presbyters were the ſame at firſt, but that the Apoſtles, towards the latter end of their Days, appointed the new Order of Superiour Biſhops. Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beveridge,</hi> and others go this way. The former <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> makes all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> mention'd in the New Teſtament to be <hi>real Biſhops,</hi> and this makes all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> mention'd there to be <hi>meer Presbyters,</hi> and pretends that <hi>Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> were ſettled afterwards.</p>
            <p>Our Author eſpouſes this laſt Opinion, and pleads for it in his looſe and confuſed way.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is no leſs precarious than the former, and receives very little Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Author of <hi>Tentamen Novum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were much more honourable, and ſafer for the <hi>Defenders of Epiſcopacy,</hi> to fix it on the beſt Foundation it hath, to wit, the Laws of the Land, by which the <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> profeſſedly held it. It was the expreſs Doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:59622:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Old Church of <hi>England,</hi> before Biſhop <hi>Land</hi>'s time, That Biſhops, as Superiour to Presbyters, are an <hi>appointment of the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> as <hi>J. O.</hi> hath prov'd in his Plea, <hi>p. 113, 114.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is agreeable to the Laws of the Land, which acknowledge nothing by <hi>Divine Right</hi> in a Biſhop, but his being a Presbyter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>37. Hen. VIII. Cap. 17.</hi> It is Enacted and Declared, <hi>That Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, and other Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, have no manner of Juriſdiction Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, but by, under, and from his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majeſty</hi> — <hi>the Supream Head of the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>to whom by Holy Scriptures all Authority and Power is wholly given, to hear and determine all manner of Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame is declared in an Act of Parliament made <hi>1 Edw. VI. Cap. 2.</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>All Authority of Juriſdiction, Spiritual and Temporal, is derived and deduced from the King's Majeſty, as Supream Head of theſe Churches and Realms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> In the Third Chapter the Rector attempts to prove, That the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59622:12"/>was mitten after <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequently after the Meeting at <hi>Miletus, Acts 20.17.</hi> In my Animadverſions on this Chapter, I have Vindicated the <hi>Ancient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers,</hi> and prov'd by ſeveral Arguments, That that Epiſtle was written before the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Miletus,</hi> and by neceſſary conſequence, the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in the Presbytery after the writing of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, on which <hi>Timothy</hi>'s ſuppoſed Epiſcopal Power is grounded. I do not pretend that my Arguments are Demonſtrations (as he calls his for the contrary Opinion) but they carry with them the greateſt probability, That that Epiſtle was written earlier than the Rector pretends, whoſe Arguments I have evinced to be weak and fallacious. Tho' if it were written after, it doth not prejudice my Argument from <hi>Acts 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> In the Fourth Chapter he pretends to prove, That Evangeliſts were fixed Church-Governours, that is, Biſhops. His main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which he would Eſtabliſh this fancy, is a begging of the Queſtion; he takes it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was a <hi>fixed Evangeliſt</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete.</hi> That they were Evangeliſts he cannot deny; that they were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,</hi> I have prov'd, in my Remarks on this Chapter. I have prov'd <hi>Philip</hi> alſo to be no fixed Evangeliſt, and vindicated <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> In the Fifth Chapter he makes a flouriſh as if he would anſwer <hi>J. O</hi>'s <hi>Plea,</hi> but leaves the
<pb facs="tcp:59622:13"/>greateſt Part untouched, and anſwers only the three firſt Arguments, and that very ſlatterinly.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a ſhort Idea of his Book, in which he diſcovers <hi>little</hi> of Argument, <hi>leſs</hi> of Reading, and <hi>nothing</hi> of Candor. Tedious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, Nauſeous Repetitions, and Scornful Reflections on <hi>J. O.</hi> and the Diſſenters, make up very near one Third of his Book. The Truth of this will appear to any intelligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have thought it worth while to have Anſwer'd it, but for the clamorous Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſome weak People, who reckon a Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, when no Reply is made unto it.</p>
            <p>His Preface being large, I muſt conſider the main parts of it in a diſtinct Chapter, and in the following Chapters ſhall Examine the ſeveral Chapters of his Book, ſo as my ſecond will anſwer to his firſt, and my third to his ſecond, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>He muſt pardon me, if I be more juſt to him, than he has been to the Author of the Plea, and if I follow him Paragraph by Paragraph, in all that is material, and may ſeem worth Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughout his Book: For I judge it below a Scholar, and a Man of Ingenuity, to pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with a few Paſſages here and there, in a Book, and leave the greateſt Part unanſwer'd, as he hath done by</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Rector goes beyond</hi> Manwaring <hi>in this Point, for he ſaith, That the</hi> King's Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oath is a voluntary Act of Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the King is not obliged by the Fundamental Conſtitution: And if a Prince ſhould not give this Aſſurance, <hi>the Rector conceives</hi> he is not obliged to Govern ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the preſent Law.</p>

But to return to our Subject;</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do the Diſſenters uſe to lodge their <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> in ſome Friend's hand, with a charge that none ſhall ſee them, except they undertake to Anſwer them, and promiſe to return them the ſame Day? This is <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair way of managing Controverſies,</hi> and it is much <hi>more unfair</hi> for a Man to triumph that a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> clog'd with inch unreaſonable Conditions is not Anſwer'd. The <hi>Rector</hi> can Name the <hi>unfair Man</hi> that hath thus managed the Controverſie of the <hi>Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Sermon,</hi> mention'd before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or do the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> pretend to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Books, and leave the greateſt part of them unanſwered? He knows who does ſo alſo, and Inſinuates in his <hi>Title Page,</hi> as if he had Anſwered the Whole, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59622:18"/>deed it is far otherwiſe. This is <hi>an unfair way of managing Controverſies,</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body is guilty of.</p>
               <p>But let's hear how he proves his Charge.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>In moſt of their Books, be the Argument what it will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pref.</note> 
                  <hi>they repreſent us as Arminians,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
               <p>Perſons that have a ſore place complain they are hurt, if one do but touch them. This Charge of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> is either true, or falſe; if true, confeſs it, and give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God; if falſe, diſprove it. I doubt the <hi>Rector</hi> cannot acquit himſelf, whatever others do; for I ſee not why he ſhould mention it here, except it were to vent his Spleen againſt poor <hi>Calvin,</hi> not the Engliſh <hi>Calvin</hi> (alias <hi>Baldwin</hi>) but the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter of that Name, upon whom he paſſeth this Cenſure;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am perſuaded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 3.</note> 
                  <hi>if the moſt underſtanding</hi> Calviniſt <hi>would repreſent the Opinions of that great Man in their true Colours, he would fright more out of their Wits, than he could ſolidly ſatisfie, or Proſelyte to his Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I ſhould attempt to repreſent the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of <hi>Calvin</hi> in their true Colours, I deſpair <hi>of ſatisfying</hi> a Man of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; nor would I be ſo ſpiteful, <hi>as to fright him out of his Wits:</hi> However, I hope I may, without prejudice to his Intellect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to the Seventeenth Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Election, and to the Prayer at Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59622:19"/>That God would <hi>ſhortly accompliſh the number of his Elect,</hi> which aſſert one of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s moſt frightful Doctrines, namely, that of <hi>Election,</hi> which implies <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or <hi>Preterition.</hi> To <hi>chooſe,</hi> is to Select ſome from among others that are <hi>left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preſume he hath declared his <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to the Articles and Liturgy, with what Sincerity he knows beſt: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his pre-conceived Notions have given ſuch a Tincture to his Eyes, as happily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him from the <hi>Intellectual danger</hi> of ſeeing ſome <hi>Truths in their own Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He wonders with what Confidence the little Striplings which Mr.</hi> Frankl. <hi>Inſtructs, ſo ſoon as they have Commenced,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>he knows not what Degree, are ready to determine the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Arminius <hi>and</hi> Calvin, <hi>as if they were Doctors of the Chair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am afraid our <hi>Rector</hi> is no great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher; for a Philoſopher, who inquires into the Reaſons of things, wonders at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why ſhould he wonder that Mr. <hi>Fr.</hi>'s Pupils ſhould with the ſame freedom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for <hi>Calvin,</hi> that many raw Youths that come from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> do for his beloved <hi>Arminius?</hi> Can that be a <hi>Crime</hi> in ours, which paſſes for a <hi>Vertue</hi> in theirs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To cure his wonder, I will tell him the Reaſon why they determine againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> beauſe <hi>Judicious</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> Mr. <hi>Fr.</hi> who as little <hi>needs</hi> my <hi>Commendation,</hi> as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59622:19"/>he <hi>fears</hi> the Rector's <hi>Cenſure,</hi> directs his Pupils to the Study of the Scriptures, and their own Hearts, which will enable them betimes to exalt the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God, and to depreſs the proud and <hi>enſlaved Will</hi> of Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One that is a Genuine Son of the Church, will not wonder that Mr. <hi>Fr.</hi> ſhould acquaint his Scholars with the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Ancient Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, whoſe Learned Divines Subſcribed the Decrees of the <hi>Calviniſtical Synod of</hi> Dort, in Conformity to the Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which preferred them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return, and never Cenſured that Act of theirs.</p>
               <p>The Senſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be ſeen in her Articles, whereof the <hi>Tenth</hi> is againſt <hi>Free-Will,</hi> the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> againſt <hi>Works preparatory to Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi> for <hi>Predeſtination and Election.</hi> The Articles were Compoſed, <hi>A.

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt forbids that Dominion which the Apoſtles coveted, and were ambitious of. What was that? Not a Tyrannical Power over their Brethren, far be it from us to impute ſuch horrid wickedneſs to ſuch good Men; they were not ſo wicked as to deſire an abſolute Power to Tyrannize over the Conſciences and Bodies of their Fellow-Subjects: The Strife among them was, <hi>which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt,</hi> Luke 22.24. They expected to be ſo many Princes, dignified with <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Titles of Honour</hi> above others. They dreamt of a Temporal Kingdom the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to ſet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59622:22"/>up, as moſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation did, and were Ambitious of the Chiefeſt Dignities in this Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.21. They thought Jeſus Chriſt would ſet up for a <hi>Temporal Prince,</hi> and they aſpire to a <hi>Temporal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi> He tells them, That <hi>Dominion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Temporal Princes,</hi> but it muſt not be ſo among his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>It ill becomes <hi>Servants</hi> to aſſume the form of <hi>Princes,</hi> when their <hi>Great Prince</hi> aſſum'd the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> Mat. 20.27, 28. <hi>Whoſoever will be chief— let him be your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, even at the Son of Man came not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. It was not a Tyrannical Dominion they Coveted, for the Dominion they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired was in Subordination to Jeſus Chriſt, as their Prince and King, under whom they deſired to be <hi>Chief Miniſters of State,</hi> next unto Jeſus Chriſt in Power and Dominion. <hi>One would ſit on his right hand, another at hi, left, in his Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 20.21. Now the Power which they deſir'd, being in Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to Jeſus Chriſt, as Lord and King, cannot be a Tyrannical Power, for this were to impute Tyranny to Chriſt Himſelf, which were Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore be imagined, That Chriſt ſhould forbid Tyrannical Dominion here, which they had no thoughts of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Dominion, like that of the Princes of the Earth, which conſiſts in a Coercive Power, worldly Grandeur, and ſwelling Titles of Honour, is here forbidden.</p>

               <p>In ſhort, the inſtance of the <hi>Alexandrian Biſhop</hi> makes altogether for us, for he was but the chief Presbyter (as an Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was the chief Deacon) choſen and named by the Presbyters without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and in his room the Presbyters ordain'd another, as <hi>J.

               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> in the next Place, ſhews the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between their Church Goverment, and that of the Apoſtles. <hi>Our Epiſcopal Government</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is eſtabliſh'd upon certain Canons and Laws made and conſented unto by the Convocation, conſiſting of Biſhops and Presbyters, and by the Multitude of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that is, their Repreſentatives in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And thus it was in the Council of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Let's a little conſider this Paragraph,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I expected, he would have ſaid the Epiſcopal Government is eſtabliſhed upon the Word of God, but he ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Truth of the Matter, that it is <hi>eſtabliſhed upon certain Canons and Laws of humane deviſing.</hi> We conceive the Laws of Chriſt and the Canons of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59622:27"/>contained in the New Teſtament, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Government of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He makes the <hi>Multitude of Believers</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be as the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the People <hi>in Parliament.</hi> Many of our Learned Antiquaries have induſtriouſly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſearch into the <hi>Original of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſome conceive they owe their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the <hi>Normans,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> others derive them higher, all confeſs the <hi>Riſe</hi> of them, like the Head of <hi>Nilus</hi> very obſcure; but this Gentleman by an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Felicity of Invention, has found them in the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 15. where no Body before ever dreamt of them.</p>
               <p>However, I am glad to find him ſpeaking any thing in favour of Parliaments, for ſome Years ago, when they were out of Requeſt, he advanced the Prerogative to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that Parliaments, the Bulwarks of the Subjects Liberty, were very inſignificant things with him. I will give a few Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1. He would exempt the Clergy from the Power of Parliaments in Point of Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. <hi>We the Clergy,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are hook'd in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Subjection, <hi>Pr. 1683,</hi> Pref. <hi>p. 4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I know not how, to Pay Taxes without the conſent of the Convocation.</hi> 2. He will not allow the aggriev'd Subject, the benefit <hi>of Petitioning and Addreſſing their Prince,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>when he is under ſome diſadvantage.</hi> 3. He makes the King in Effect the ſole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of our Eſtates, and ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sermon</hi> 1. p. 11</note> 
                  <hi>we muſt ſupply his Occaſions, the</hi> five hundred <hi>at once
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59622:28"/>(i. e. <hi>a Houſe of Commons</hi>) <hi>ſhould forbid us, becauſe our Gold and Silver bear his Image and Superſcription.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> The meaning is this, the King has Power to Tax us without the Conſent of Parliament. 4. He adds, <hi>and to this</hi> (i. e. to ſupply the King without the Conſent of Parliament) <hi>we are bound in Conſcience, though the Prince ſhould be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper and a Tyrant:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 13, 14, 15.</note> Nay, ſaith our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, a Violent and Originally unjuſt Power, by ſucceſs becomes a Legal and Righteous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> 5. He complains that <hi>the Rights of the People were</hi> too much <hi>ſweld, their Properties too</hi> much <hi>enlarged, their Liberties</hi> too much <hi>extended.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 17.</note> This was in the Year 1683. when the Popiſh Plot had been ſtifled, ſham-Plots ſet on Foot for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the beſt Patriots, the Rights and Franchiſes of Cities and Corporations undermined and violated, Parliaments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, Popery and Slavery breaking in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly upon us under the Conduct and Influence of the then Duke of <hi>York.</hi> 6. He affirms, <hi>that the Prince is accountable to none but God for any miſgovernment, nay he is in Effect,</hi> continues he, <hi>the ſole Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if he pleaſes to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp and Exerciſe it, nor can the Subject conſcientiouſly reſiſt him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 21.</note> 7. He thinks <hi>it's one main ground of Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to deprive the Subject from being his own Judge and Aſſerter of his own Priviledges.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">p. 22.</note> He conceives <hi>the Kings Coronation Oath is a voluntary Act of Grace, unto which he is not

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 23.</note> 9. <hi>If a Prince ſhould not give this Aſſurance, it is my Judgment</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he is not obliged to govern ſtrictly by the preſent Law.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I doubt I have tired the Reader with theſe <hi>Political Maxims. Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring</hi> were dull Fellows to this <hi>grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Politicks,</hi> who has left it wholly to his Prince's good Nature, whether he will make uſe of his <hi>multitude of Believers,</hi> or no. He is the <hi>ſole ſoveraign Power,</hi> and <hi>not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take the Coronation Oath,</hi> or to <hi>govern according to the Eſtabliſhed Laws,</hi> if we may believe our <hi>Rector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not trouble my ſelf, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by making Remarks upon theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which are but a few, of many, with which his Three Sermons abound. All theſe you may find in the firſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sermons were deſign'd (as he tells us,<note place="margin">Pref. 10 the Serm. <hi>p. 3.</hi>
                  </note> and I dare believe him) <hi>To aſſure the higher Powers of his ſteadineſs and fidelity, and of may more in theſe Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</hi> It was a Point of mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to <hi>the higher Powers, to be aſſured of the Rector's Fidelity,</hi> eſpecially in a time when <hi>the Prince was under ſome diſadvantage.</hi> Moſt happy Prince! who can aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Fidelity of ſuch a Man as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> for in him he aſſures himſelf of <hi>many more in theſe Northern Climates.</hi> The higher Powers then in being, were highly obliged to ſo Profound a Caſuiſt, who by another
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59622:29"/>
                  <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> attempted to prove the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Abſolute Monarchy, and Arbitrary Government: But all well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Expectants have not the Happineſs of being Preferred according to their Merits.</p>
               <p>But to return to his Parallel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> under the Conduct of the Holy Ghoſt, injoyn'd the <hi>neceſſary forbearance</hi> of a <hi>few</hi> things <hi>to avoid offence,</hi> Acts 15.28. The Convocation has made Canons, injoyning the Practiſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>unneceſſary things</hi> to create of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. That Council widen'd the Door to Church-Fellowſhip, by taking away the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ceremonial Terms</hi> of Communion, and breaking down the <hi>partition Wall</hi> between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> The Convocation has <hi>ſtraitned</hi> the <hi>Door</hi> to <hi>Church-Fellowſhip,</hi> by ſetting up <hi>new ceremonial Terms</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and erecting a <hi>partition Wall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Brethren.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> freed the Chriſtians from a <hi>divine Yoke,</hi> namely, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;</hi> the Convocation binds a <hi>humane Yoke</hi> of burthenſome Ceremonies on our Necks. The Apoſtles aſſerted that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty,</hi> which the Lord Jeſus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a dear rate, and obliged us to maintain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. Others unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of it, and mancipate us under more beggarly Elements than thoſe of the Jewiſh Pedagogy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. Had the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Succeſſors</hi> imitated the excellent temper
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59622:29"/>of their wiſe <hi>Fathers</hi> in this Council, the Chriſtian World had not been divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many Factions as it is at this Day. When <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s <hi>little Finger</hi> proves heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Loins,</hi> no wonder there is a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made no <hi>new Canon,</hi> only thought fit to continue ſome <hi>divine Prohibitions,</hi> that were obliging before, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.29. The Convocation hath made but 141 <hi>new Canons,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of which there is no <hi>Divine Law.</hi> The Canons of that Council are contained in <hi>one ſhort Verſe,</hi> v. 29. The Canons of our Synod make a large Volume.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Canons of that Council have no Penalty annexed; the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ends thus, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>From which if ye keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well. Fare ye well.</hi> Our Canons thunder out terrible <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, and <hi>Excommunications, ipſo facto,</hi> not known to the Apoſtles, againſt all the breakers of them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Canons at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were made by the <hi>Apoſtles, Elders,</hi> and the <hi>whole Church,</hi> v. 22. Our Canons are made by the <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters in Convocation,</hi> which are the true Church of <hi>England</hi> by repreſentation, as Can. 139. obligeth us to believe, on pain of <hi>Excommunication.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> makes the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <hi>to repreſent the Multitude of Believers,</hi> that is, the <hi>Church,</hi> according to his Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel; for he makes the Biſhops to anſwer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59622:30"/>the Apoſtles, the Presbyters the Elders, and the Parliament the whole Church, or <hi>multitude of Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I leave the Rector to the Cenſure of his Dioceſan, who is obliged by the Canon, <hi>to Excommunicate, and not to reſtore him, until he repent, and publickly revoke this his wicked error</hi>

               <p>I hope the Impartial Reader is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced how exactly the Epiſcopal Government, as deſcribed by this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, agrees with the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is angry with <hi>J. O.</hi> for ſaying <hi>Pariſh Prieſts have no power of Diſcipline;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pref. p. 14</note> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>They have power to rebuke and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and ſuſpend for a while from the Lord's Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in effect an acknowledgment of the Truth of what <hi>J. O.</hi> Aſſerts. They have power <hi>to rebuke and admoniſh,</hi> ſo have private Perſons, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. The Admonitions of a Maſter, who hath no Power to uſe the Rod, will have little influence upon froward Lads. But <hi>Pariſh Miniſters can ſuſpend for a while:</hi> For how long? But for fourteen Days at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; and then they are obliged to put the whole Matter out of their Power, and to commit it to the Ordinary. See the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before the Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true State of the Caſe is this:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59622:30"/>1. They have no power left them to judge whom to Baptize, and whom not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 68.</note> but muſt Baptize all that are offered, though the Children of <hi>Jews, Infidels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> &amp;c. who have no right to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have no power to forbear giving the Euchariſt to any one, how notorious an Offender ſoever, unleſs they will proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him at the Biſhop's Court, nor then, but for once: So that if he pays his Fees, and be Abſolved there, though the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter know him to be never ſo Impenitent, he muſt give it him the next time. And the Proſecution is ſo troubleſome, odious and fruitleſs, that it is very rarely undertaken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have no Power to call Perſons to Repentance openly before the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They have no Power to judge any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be Excommunicate, nor to abſolve any Perſon that is Penitent after Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; they only read the Chancellor's Sentence (who is uſually a Lay-man) ſent them in the Biſhop's Name; much like our <hi>Cryers</hi> in Civil Courts, that publiſh the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Court. Yea, though they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their Conſciences, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Decree is ſometimes unjuſt, <hi>Et cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve errante,</hi> Excommunicating a Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon ſcrupling a Ceremony (as was done in the late Reigns) or abſolving an Impenitent Perſon, who hath Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Notorious Scandal, yet they muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59622:31"/>publiſh it, or be Suſpended. All the Power left them, is the Privilege of being the Chancellor's Servants to execute all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, without once Examining whether they be right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Many Sober Conformiſts, who have a tender concern for the Souls under their Charge, have complained of this Reſtraint, and impute the growing Debaucheries of the People to the want of Pariſh Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>The very Liturgy complains, That the <hi>Godly Primitive Diſcipline</hi> is wanting in our Churches. See the <hi>Office of Commination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Pariſh-Miniſters have <hi>the Power of Diſcipline,</hi> as the <hi>Rector</hi> would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the more to blame they for admitting all Perſons promiſcuouſly to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. It is rarely that any ſcandalous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are excluded, as they ought to be, Mat 18.15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 5.2 Cor. 3.6.</p>
               <p>His Fancy that our Miniſters <hi>ask leave of the Lay-Elders to Suſpend</hi> is a great miſtake. Though common Senſe might teach him, that two or three Experienced Perſons of the Congregation (whom he Stiles <hi>Lay-Elders</hi>) in conjunction with the Miniſters, are more competent Judges of Offences within the Congregation, than a <hi>Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi> who lives at a diſtance, and is a meer Stranger, and uſually makes the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Office, without any great regard to the Salvation of Souls.</p>
               <p>He complains, <hi>That the Diſſenters call them

               <p>The Reader may ſee the Remarks upon that Story in <hi>J.

In all Ordinations by Presbyters, there is a Moderator, or Preſident, who is the Chief Manager of the Action for Order's ſake, but in Conjunction with his Brethren, over whom he claims no Juriſdiction or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in Power. This was the State of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> their Biſhops were only <hi>Nominal</hi> and <hi>Titular,</hi> but had no Power over their Brethren: They were only for Orders ſake the Principal Managers of Ordination.

               <p>The Biſhops they receiv'd from the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> were made by two of their <hi>Titular Biſhops,</hi>

               <p>One of the Articles againſt <hi>John Hus,</hi> the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Martyr, was that he affirm'd, That <hi>all Prieſts are of like Power,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That they had no real Biſhops Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Presbyters is evident from their own Teſtimony. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them (as ſome others would do now) that they had Biſhops, <hi>to whom they

               <p>
                  <hi>The laſt that are Receiv'd</hi> (or Ordain'd) <hi>are to do nothing without the Leave and Licenſe of their Seniours Receiv'd (or Ordain'd) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; as alſo, they that are firſt ought not to attempt any thing without the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Companions, to the end that all things might be done amongſt us in Order.</hi>

               <p>The Reader may note here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Waldenſian Biſhops</hi> were only the <hi>Seniour Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe had no Power over other Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they cou'd not put forth any Act of Government, <hi>without the Approbation of their Brethren:</hi> So that the <hi>Waldenſian Churches</hi> were Govern'd <hi>by the Common Council of the Presbyters or Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. All this was for <hi>Order's ſake.</hi> I leave
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59622:35"/>it to the Impartial, to Judge whether this ſort of Government has any thing of the Form of our Epiſcopal Government.</p>
               <p>Theſe Teſtimonies are ſufficient to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unprejudiced Perſons, that the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had no Biſhops Superiour to Presbyters, but I will add a few more <hi>ex abundanti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That they had no Biſhops in a proper Senſe appears by Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription of them. <q>The People of the <hi>Valleys</hi> were a part of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who four <hi>hundred Years</hi> ſince<note n="*" place="margin">He ends his Hiſtory with the Year <hi>1563.</hi>

               <p>Obſerve in this Quotation,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He aſcribes to the <hi>Waldenſes certain Miniſters</hi> (not Biſhops) whom they call'd <hi>Paſtors.</hi> If there had been any Superiour Biſhops among them, ſo exact an Hiſtorian would not have omitted them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith, they <hi>agreed in Doctrinos and Rites</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Geneva.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I hope the <hi>Rector</hi> will not affirm, That the Proteſtants of <hi>Geneva</hi> had <hi>Biſhops;</hi> no more had the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who agreed with them in Rites and Doctrines, and among other Doctrines in this of <hi>the Parity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters,</hi> and ſo readily united with them.</p>

               <p n="2">2. This great number of Miniſters muſt be Ordain'd by Presbyters, for the Biſhops would <hi>ſend none of them,</hi> as was obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               <p>We ſee here, notwithſtanding the ſevere Perſecutions againſt the poor <hi>Lollards,</hi> they grew and increas'd exceedingly, as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Faithful and Laborious Miniſters,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59622:38"/>who muſt be Ordain'd by Presbyters, the Biſhops being their Sworn Enemies, and obliged by their <hi>Pontifical Oath</hi> to extirpate them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lollards</hi> here were a Branch of the old <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> as we prov'd before, and as may be gathered from that Paſſage in <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius,</hi> who ſaith,<note place="margin">

               <p>And being I am upon this Quotation, I will obſerve one thing in <hi>Rainerius;</hi> he ſaith they were <hi>more pernicious to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>than any other Sect,</hi> for three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. <q>Becauſe more laſting; for ſome ſay that it hath been ever ſince the time of <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and others deduce it ſince the time of the Apoſtles. 2. Becauſe more general; there is hardly any Country into which it hath not crept. 3. Becauſe all others are abominable to God for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of their Blaſphemies; but this of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> only carries with it a great ſhew of Piety, becauſe they live juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men, and believe truly of God, and all the Articles of the Creed, only they blaſpheme and hate the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If they are ſo Ancient as <hi>Rainerius</hi> ſeems to confeſs, and had no Biſhops, as I have prov'd, <hi>J. O</hi>'s.

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59622:38"/>I hope I have ſufficiently prov'd that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> had Superiour Biſhops for 500 Years laſt paſt, and Explain'd, or rather Vindicated his <hi>Learned Neighbour</hi>'s (as he calls it) but indeed <hi>J. O</hi>'s. <hi>Quotation.</hi>

               <p>It ſhould ſeem, if I underſtand him, <hi>that a ſtrong preſumption</hi> and <hi>moral aſſurance,</hi> are one and the ſame with him, which moſt will acknowledge to be very different things.

Or rather, that their <hi>moral aſſurance</hi> is no more than a <hi>ſtrong preſumption,</hi> and ſo the meaning is, they ſtrongly preſume they are Miniſters, but cannot be certain upon this Principle. This is but very cold comfort to one who labours under Fears and Temptations, about his acceptance with God in the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry. The inextricable difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Succeſſion, which have puzzled the moſt Learned and diligent Inquirers, may increaſe, but can have no tendency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his Doubts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> prov'd their Call to the Miniſtry by the <hi>Succeſs,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nor are they ſingular in this Principle, it is aſſerted by the Learned Defenders of the <hi>Reformation</hi> (in their Diſcourſes againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the ſtiff Maintainers of this Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) and they have demonſtrated, That the Being of the Chriſtian Church cannot depend upon this Succeſſion, and that it hath been interrupted again and again.

               <p>HE takes a great deal of pains to prove that the Apoſtles were Superiour to Presbyters, which no Body ever deny'd. This is the chief Scope of the firſt Chapter of his Book, in which he hath furniſhed us with ſome rare Notions of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>He tells us,<note place="margin">P. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Church of the</hi> Jews <hi>was the firſt eſtabliſhed Church in the World, that we know of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had God no Church in the World for about 24.50 Years, till the Law was given upon Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> Were there no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Congregations, no <hi>Divine</hi> Laws of Worſhip in the World before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time? We read of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Name of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4.3, 4, 24. And were there no Aſſemblies for thoſe Acts of Worſhip? We read of the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>the Daughters of Men,</hi> and that the mixture of the profeſſedly <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed</hi> of <hi>Seth</hi> with the prophane <hi>Gainites,</hi> ſill'd the World with Wickedneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. The degeneracy of the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God at that Time, caus'd the Flood. He that can believe that God had no Church before the Flood, may alſo believe there never was a Flood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59622:40"/>Did <hi>Noah,</hi> the Father of the new World, who had immediate Rcvelation from God, as moſt of the Patriarchs had, eſtabliſh no Church among his numerous Poſterity? Was God indifferent whether he would have a Church? Or was <hi>Noah</hi> unfaithful in tranſmitting the <hi>Divine Eſtabliſhment</hi> to his Off-ſpring? It is true, they ſoon degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. but that's an Argument they had been a Covenant-People.</p>
               <p>Was there no Church eſtabliſh'd in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brabam</hi>'s <hi>numerous</hi> and <hi>princely Family?</hi> Gen. 14.14. &amp; 23.6. He erected Altars for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and call'd upon the Lord whereever he came.

               <p>Did righteous <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who was <hi>Prieſt of the moſt High God,</hi> as the Patriarchs generally were, take no care to eſtabliſh a Church among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</p>
               <p>I hope one may lawfully doubt this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Notions of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> who thus blunders about the very <hi>exiſtence of a Church.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Church was govern'd by a High-Prieſt, Inferior Prieſts, and Levites.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I begin now to ſuſpect the Reaſon, why he would have no eſtabliſh'd Church
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59622:41"/>before the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> he does not read of any <hi>ſubordinate Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> that were ſubject to the <hi>Patriarchal Prieſts.</hi> He ſeems to be content that God ſhould have no Church in the World for almoſt 2500 Years, rather than want a Model for his Hierarchy, conſiſting of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> This is agreeable enough to his Hypotheſis, that Dioceſan Biſhops are eſſential to a Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The High-Prieſt, Prieſts and Levites are not the Model for Goſpel Churches, for we read of no Inſtitution of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in the New Teſtament. We find <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> there, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. but the Scripture-Biſhop is the ſame with the Scripture-Presbyter.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>I could wiſh this excellent Epiſtle of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> which I hear is lately done into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> were in every hand: It would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfie the unprejudiced, that the Order of Superiour Biſhops had no being in the Church in <hi>Clemens</hi> his Time. He writes to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church about Schiſm, and that occaſſion'd by ſome of their Presbyters, but has not one Word of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a Superiour Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> as the remedy againſt Schiſm.</p>
               <p>The only Paſſage that gives the leaſt umbrage to a Dioceſan Epiſcopacy is that which mentions <hi>High-Prieſts, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law, and a little after, <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> under the Goſpel. Not that he makes the former Patterns of the latter, for then he would have ſaid, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> (as the Rector falſly affirms he doth) but he expreſly ſaith, the Apoſtles inſtituted <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt explain <hi>Clemen's Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> by the New Teſtament, and not by the Old, for he ſpeaks of an <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtitution</hi> which we muſt look for in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59622:42"/>
                  <hi>Pauls Epiſtles,</hi> and not <hi>in the Levitical Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we find <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>'s <hi>Biſhop</hi> are the ſame. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Biſhops were Presbyters, for there were ſeveral of them in one Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Clemen</hi>'s Biſhops are <hi>but</hi> Presbyters, of which there were ſeveral in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The force of <hi>Clemens</hi> his Argument is this, As the Old Teſtament Church was guided by a Divine Inſtitution in the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prieſthood,</hi> ſo muſt we in the Goſpel-Miniſtry: They reſted in the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Old Law, and we muſt in thoſe of the New Teſtament. The <hi>Orders</hi> are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as he expreſly declares, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enjoyning them is the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>according to this Pattern, himſelf being as it were the High-Prieſt, the twelve Apoſtles his ſeconds, and the ſeventy Diſciples ſtill of a loner Rank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſpoken with great Aſſurance, <hi>it is manifeſt,</hi> ſaith he, but you muſt take his bare Word for Proof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Is it manifeſt,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>as it were</hi> the High Prieſt? This is a dangerous Aſſertion, and ſavours of <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny the reality of Chriſt's Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Satisfaction, the <hi>Rector</hi> makes him but <hi>as it were</hi> High Prieſt. If he will be at the Pains to read the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he will find that Jeſus Chriſt had a <hi>real Prieſthood,</hi> and that he was and is the <hi>High Prieſt of our Profeſſion.</hi> I hope the Rector is no <hi>Socinian,</hi> but when I compare this with ſome odd Paſſages of his about <hi>Juſtification,</hi> of which hereafter, its no breach of Charity to ſay, he ought to clear himſelf from the <hi>appearance of that growing Hereſie.</hi> They that are <hi>ſound in the Faith</hi> ought to ſtudy a <hi>Form of ſound Words.</hi> The Scripture no where calls Jeſus Chriſt <hi>as it were</hi> a High Prieſt. He that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Jeſus Chriſt from the <hi>Honour</hi> of a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59622:43"/>
                  <hi>real Prieſthood,</hi> to advance the <hi>honourable Order</hi> of Biſhops, is but <hi>as it were</hi> a Friend, that is no real one to either.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Is it manifeſt,</hi> that the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were under Chriſt as the Prieſts under the Chief Prieſts? That they were under him none Queſtions; but not as <hi>Prieſts,</hi> for they were none as all Proteſtants confeſs: And I hope, this Gentleman will not make them Prieſts in a Popiſh Senſe to offer up the <hi>Idolatrous Sacrifice</hi> of the Maſs. The number of Twelve has no relation to the Prieſthood. The Prieſts were divided into twenty four Orders, and not into twelve, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.</p>

               <p>An Error in <hi>Politicks</hi> is excuſable enough in a <hi>Divine,</hi> but a Man, who takes upon

               <p>I preſume he meant <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> for he explains himſelf, that <hi>Chriſt left his Church in the Power of Twelve.</hi> This alſo is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, for <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the Twelve, was gone, or going <hi>to his own Place.</hi> It is true, <hi>Matthias</hi> ſucceeded in his Room, but Chriſt left not his Church <hi>in the Power of Twelve,</hi> excluſive of other Apoſtles. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not one of the Twelve, was not Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Chief Apoſtles.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.5. and 12.11.</note> Many judge <hi>Barnabas</hi> an Apoſtle of equal Authority with the reſt.</p>
               <p>He thinks <hi>the Church was govern'd after Chriſt's Aſcenſion by the Apoſtles in a Parity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 2.</note> that we eaſily grant, but do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Proof of it, <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither did he commit the Power unto the Twelve themſelves, but was wholly ſilent therein.</hi> How then came they by it? He adds, <hi>by Order of Nature, one would think.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One would think</hi> the Rector were in a Dream, when theſe Words dropt from him. He makes the Apoſtles to govern the Church by an <hi>uſurped Power,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt never committed to them.</hi> If this be ſo, all their Acts become nullities, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the Foundations of Chriſtianity, and makes their <hi>Epiſcopal Succeſſors</hi> act by an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59622:45"/>You muſt not admire, that he denies the governing Power to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Apoſtles <hi>had it not from Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as he poſitively ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>He is poſitive, they had it not from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but is not certain how they came by it, only <hi>he thinks it muſt by Order of Nature fall to their ſhare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhou'd help us to a <hi>New Dictionary</hi> to explain his Terms: What he means by the <hi>Order of Nature</hi> is hard to underſtand. If he means by it, that the <hi>Eldeſt ſhould be preferr'd,</hi> as in the <hi>Patriarchal Government,</hi> his Expreſſion is very improper, for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Power was not founded in <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation,</hi> but in a <hi>poſitive Inſtitution,</hi> and if the <hi>Order of Nature</hi> muſt carry the Power, the Eldeſt Apoſtle muſt <hi>ſucceed in the Government,</hi> which deſtroys the Parity he allows.</p>

               <p>We will now proceed to his Scripture Inſtances of Ordination, in which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Presbyters had no ſhare.</p>
               <p>In ſome of his Inſtances, Ordination is not concern'd, in others, Presbyters could not be concern'd, becauſe they were not in being, in others the Presbyters had a hand, as we ſhall evince, notwithſtanding his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to exclude them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It's obſervable here;</p>
               <p n="1">1. He acknowledges the People's right to chuſe Miniſters; Why then are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, and no Overtures made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Reſtoring of this Power to them?

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59622:46"/>of Believers,</hi> to contribute their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have their <hi>Ancient Priviledges</hi> reſtored.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> and the <hi>Serving of Tables</hi> are diſtinct Offices, and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> in the ordinary exerciſe of <hi>them,</hi> otherwiſe there were no force in the Apoſtles reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they muſt not <hi>leave the Word to ſerve Tables.</hi> If ſerving of Tables was a hinderance to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Miniſtry, would it not be alſo to that of the <hi>Deacons.</hi> What Abſurdity do they put upon the Apoſtles, who would make them ſay, <hi>We cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Miniſtry of the Word, and ſerve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wherefore Brethren, chooſe you among you Seven Men, whom we may appoint to do both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The occaſion of chuſing <hi>Deacons</hi> was the neceſſity of the Poor, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were deſirous to have relieved out of

                  <hi>the Council of</hi> Neoceſarea <hi>determines there ought to be Seven in every Church; but we having adapted the Opinion of the Fathers to the Apoſtles Expreſſions, do find that they ſpeak not of thoſe who</hi> Miniſtred in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries, <hi>but of ſuch as</hi> Served at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.

               <p>This Teſtimony is the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as not only containing the Opinion of 166 Biſhops, who lived about the latter end of the Seventh Age, but affirming the Senſe of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of former Ages to be the ſame with theirs.

No, ſaith the Rector, <hi>it makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing for it.</hi> But let's hear his Proof.</p>
               <p>He has four things to offer, which if they fail him, our Inſtance holds good.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>It's no doubt with him but that</hi> Timothy <hi>was Ordained twice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 20</note> 
                  <hi>firſt a Presbyter,</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy with the Presbytery, <hi>and then a Biſhop by</hi> Paul. How will he prove this? Why, <hi>Paul was Ordain'd twice, firſt a Miniſter of the Word in ordinary, then unto the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. His Proof wants another. Was the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> but an <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> at firſt? Who was <hi>called not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.1. who was caught up into the Third Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and had abundance of Revelations, <hi>v.</hi> 7. who ſaw the Lord Jeſus, and reckons himſelf one of the Apoſtles from the time of his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Converſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. <hi>Neither went I up to Jeruſalem</hi> (he ſpeaks of the time immediately following his Converſion) <hi>to them which were Apoſtles
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59622:58"/>before me.</hi> This implies he was an Apoſtle himſelf at that time<note n="*" place="margin">Pearſ. Ann. Paul. <hi>p. 2.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Was he but an <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> who had the <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. He that has the Confidence to make one of the <hi>chief Apoſtles</hi> an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſter, may with equal aſſurance aſſert every ordinary Miniſter to be a chief Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſaith, That he was <hi>not taught his Goſpel by Men, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.12. Was he but an <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> who receiv'd his Goſpel by <hi>extraordinary Revelation?</hi> Biſhop <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Judgment, which is follow'd by the Rector in his Annals, I preſume is of ſome value with him. The Biſhop will ſet him at rights: he owns <hi>Paul</hi> to be an Apoſtle, before the Miſſion mention'd in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2. This he doth both in his <hi>Annals,</hi> p. 2. and in his <hi>Lection in Act. Apoſt.</hi> p. 74, 75. So doth <hi>Euſebius, Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> II. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was ſent by Revelation unto the Gentiles, before the Ordination mention'd in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 22.18.21. The Ordination mention'd there did not make him an Apoſtle, as the <hi>Rector</hi> dreams, but he had an antecedent immediate Call from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt thought fit he ſhould enter upon the Stated Exerciſe of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Miniſtry amongſt the Gentiles, at the Door of Ordination by Presbyters, for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59622:59"/>a Preſident of Ordination to the Gentile Churches. When the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles enters at this Door, it's fit that ordinary Miniſters ſhou'd; and if Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may lay hands on an Apoſtle, much more on inferiour Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He allows that <hi>Timothy</hi> was made a <hi>Presbyter by Presbyters,</hi> but that he was made a Biſhop by <hi>Paul,</hi> is barely Aſſerted and not Proved.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He examines the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> If <hi>Timothy</hi> was Ordain'd <hi>but once,</hi> then, ſaith he, <hi>by Prophecy,</hi> ſignifies <hi>by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Abſtract for the Concrete, and theſe Prophets were</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I add</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Presbytery here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, or Presbyters themſelves, might have been Prophets too,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>and Ordained</hi> Timothy <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Prophecy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Lets ſee how the Words run with this Explication, <hi>Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophets, with the laying on of the Hands of the Prophets.</hi> Profound Sence! He is reſolved to make <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Prophets</hi> of all that are concern'd in Ordination, but the miſchief on't is, the Biſhops whoſe Cauſe he pleads, are neither one nor t'other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prophecy</hi> with him ſignifies <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſo that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was Ordain'd <hi>by Prophets with Prophets.</hi> The <hi>Rector</hi> has highly obliged the Learned World by this Famous Commentary. If
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59622:59"/>you ſhou'd ask why he <hi>degrades</hi> Paul <hi>an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> into an <hi>inferiour</hi> Order of <hi>Prophets,</hi> I hope it will ſatisfie you, that he hath made amends by <hi>exalting</hi> inferiour Presbyters, into a <hi>ſuperiour Order</hi> of Prophets. One while <hi>Paul</hi> is an <hi>ordinary Miniſter</hi> with him, another while <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and ſometimes he is content, provided he do not ſtand in the way of his beloved Epiſcopacy, he ſhould be an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Truth is, <hi>by Prophecy</hi> reſpects the <hi>Prophecies that went before of</hi> Timothy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. It ſeems they were many, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Perſons Prophecying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and but one if we conſider the thing Prophecied, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Prophecy</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">III. He lets us ſee what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>Presbytery. 'Tis a Word bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the Jewiſh Church.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That he made Chriſt and the twelve Apoſtles to anſwer unto the High Prieſt, and the inferiour Prieſts, <hi>p.</hi> 1, 2. And he

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Where doth he find that <hi>Moſes took the Heads of the Twelve Tribes, to be his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants in the Government,</hi> before the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Elders were choſen. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf gives a different Account: he ſaith, he judged the People alone, until <hi>Jethro,</hi> his Father in Law, adviſed him to joyn others with him in the Government; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he choſe, not Twelve Heads of the ſeveral Tribes, but <hi>Rulers of Thouſands, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Hundreds, of Fifties, and of Tens,</hi> Ex. 18.13, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.15. That there were <hi>Heads of the Twelve Tribes</hi> every body knows, but that theſe were choſen excluſive or others, to be <hi>Moſes his Aſſiſtants in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is a <hi>new diſcovery,</hi> which no body knew before.

                  <hi>had his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in the Cities where he had ſettled Churches, as is clear from</hi> Acts 15. <hi>but that Apoſtle was head of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Doubtleſs every Conſtituted Church had a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which was the <hi>Church's Presbytery,</hi> and not the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as he calls it. <hi>His</hi> Presbytery is a Form of Expreſſion not known in the New Teſtament. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not call the Presbytery of any Church <hi>his Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What if two Apoſtles ſettled a Church in Conjunction, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59622:61"/>many; whoſe then was the Presbytery? was it divided between both? or were they <hi>joint heads</hi> of the Presbytery? or did one reſign his right in them to another? Perhaps Mr. <hi>G.</hi> can tell us how the Point was ſettled, without the danger of making <hi>two Apoſtolical Heads of the Presbytery of a Church,</hi> for that would be a bad Preſident, and might warrant the ſetting up of <hi>Two Biſhops</hi> in one Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Elders of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not <hi>one Apoſtle,</hi> but Apoſtles Superiour to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2. and ſo were <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.</hi> But we do not find that they were under the Inſpection of one Apoſtle, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or Evangeliſt, more than another, but Subject to all, and willing to be guided by them, as there was occaſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Were not the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Heads of the Biſhops alſo? This we have proved already. The Superiority of the Apoſtles over the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> doth not in the leaſt diminiſh their Power as ſuch; it was fit they ſhould act under the Inſpection of the Apoſtles, who were Infallibly Aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>After a great deal of needleſs labour to himſelf and Reader, at length he <hi>grants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> That <hi>Timothy was Ordain'd by the Presbytery, of which</hi> Paul <hi>was the principal Head</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you have his own Confeſſion, That <hi>Timothy was Ordain'd by the Presbytery.</hi> Truth is great, and will one time or other
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59622:62"/>extort Self-condemning Teſtimonies out of the Mouths of Adverſaries. But he adds, That <hi>Paul was the principal Head of this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Head is an Ambiguous Word: If he means by it <hi>Supreme Governour,</hi> it belongs properly to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Head over all things to it, Eph.</hi> 1.22. &amp; 5.23. No Apoſtle is ever call'd <hi>Head,</hi> much leſs <hi>principal Head,</hi> either of the Church or of the Presbytery, in all the <hi>N. Teſtament.</hi> It's a Title the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> affects.</p>
               <p>If he means a <hi>ſubordinate Governour,</hi> as I preſume he doth, he was no more the <hi>Head of this Presbytery,</hi> than of all other Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, not only in Churches Planted by him, but in all others to whom the Spirit guided him. His Power was the ſame in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Coloſs,</hi> where he found Churches Eſtabliſhed by others, as in <hi>Epheſus</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> where lie ſettled Churches himſelf.</p>
               <p>If the Apoſtle join'd the Presbytery with him in Ordination, as the <hi>Rector</hi> confeſſeth he did, it is ſufficient to demonſtrate, <hi>That Presbyters have an inherent Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle's being Preſident of the Presbytery, makes no more for Biſhops, than it doth for Presbyters, for neither of them pretend to Succeed the Apoſtles in the extent of Apoſtolical Power; and all Presbyteries have a Moderator, or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for Order's ſake.</p>

               <p>He Flurts at the Learned and Judicious Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> whoſe Name will live in the Church of God, when ſuch Men as he are written in the Duſt. He diſingeniouſly makes the Dr. to ſay, <hi>That we are Juſtify'd by Faith with good Works;</hi>

                  <hi>that Faith is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby Juſtification is convey'd, and good Works wherewith it is conferr'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhou'd have ſhew'd the place where Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith ſo, but this he cou'd not do.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Remarks upon bus Second Chapter of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi> The Apoſtles left the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the Presbyters. This Eſtabliſhment his laſt, divine, perpetual. <hi>Acts 20.</hi> Explain'd. The Government by Presbyters in parity never alter'd. Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery a Divine Remedy againſt Schiſm. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Biſhops not the Remedy. <hi>Timothy</hi> no Dioceſan Biſhop, an unfixed Evangeliſt. Of the Aſian Angels, not ſo call'd from the Provincial Guardian Angels. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Biſhop, not Dioceſan. <hi>Titus</hi> no Dioceſan Biſhop. Presbyters are Rulers.</head>
               <p>HE undertakes <hi>to ſhew that St.</hi> Paul, <hi>toward the declining part of his Life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Churches, did not commit the Government to the Presbyterles in Parity, but appointed one as Supreme to preſide over them in his abſence, and by conſequence to Succeed him, when he departed the World. This</hi>(ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall demonſtrate he did in the Churches of</hi> Epheſus <hi>and</hi> Crete, <hi>and by a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſequence in all his other Churches, and the reſt of the Apoſtles muſt be preſum'd to have done the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Apoſtle did not appoint <hi>one Presbyter as Supreme, to preſide over the rest,</hi> and to <hi>Succeed</hi> him in the Government of the Presbyters, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his own Confeſſion muſt lodge in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Churches in Parity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59622:67"/>2. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not <hi>ordinary Presbyters,</hi> but extraordinary Officers, that is, <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and as ſuch were Superiour to Presbyters, as <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were: There is not the leaſt hint in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that they were Ordain'd to be the <hi>Apoſtles Succeſſors</hi> in <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle did commit the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in his abſence, to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery in a Parity, (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 18.) and that when he was taking his laſt leave of them, without thoughts of ſeeing them any more, <hi>v.</hi> 25. This was the proper Seaſon for him to provide a <hi>ſirgle Perſon</hi> to <hi>Succeed</hi> him in the Preſidency over the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> had ſuch a <hi>Preſidency</hi> been of neceſſary and perpetual continuance in the Church. It is but rational to affirm, That when the Apoſtles took their final leave of any Church, then was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time to take care of it's future Government. It is not to be imagin'd that the Holy Apoſtles wou'd be wanting in their Duty towards the Churches in ſuch a Conjuncture as this.</p>
               <p>They were Faithful Stewards of God's Houſe, and gave the neceſſary Rules for its future Government and Conſervation: accordingly the Apoſtle is very particular and expreſs, in giving Directions about the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> after his departure.</p>
               <p>He ſends for the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Preaches his Farewel Sermon to them, <hi>Asts</hi> 20.17—36. In all which there is not one word of ſetting a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon over them, but the whole Government of the Church is committed to them in a State of Parity: And leaſt any ſhou'd think this was a <hi>prudential Conſtitution,</hi> he tells them this Power was conſign'd to them by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, who made them Biſhops to Feed</hi> (or Rule) <hi>the Church of God,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>The Elders, to whom the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was thus committed by the Holy Ghoſt, took their ſolemn and final leave of <hi>Paul,</hi> with many Tears, <hi>ſorrowing moſt of all for the words
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59622:67"/>which he ſpake, that they ſhou'd ſee his face no more,</hi> ver. 38.</p>
               <p>Whether he did return again is not material at all; it's evident he thought he ſhould not, and the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> thought ſo alſo,</p>
               <p>There is no one Presbytery of which the Apoſtle took ſuch a Solemn leave, as he did of this; and there is no doubt, if it had been the mind of God that a ſingle Perſon ſhould be ſet over them, but the Apoſtle would have mention'd it at this time. He tells them in his Charge to them, That he <hi>ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to declare to them the whole Counſel of God,</hi> Acts 20.27. and immediately adds, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt made them Biſhops of that Flock;</hi> this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is part of the Council of God, That the Church be Govern'd <hi>by the Elders in Parity.</hi> If the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of Biſhops had been any part of the Council of God, the Apoſtle would not have with-held it from the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> at this time. They that affirm, That the Government of this Church was afterwards chang'd, muſt bring as clear Proof for it, as we do for this Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>It is very plain and inconteſtable, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle left the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the Presbyters of that Church, when he took his final leave of them: And is it as plain, that the <hi>First Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> upon which his Epiſcopacy is Founded, was written after this Settlement of a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Presbytery,</hi> which moſt Ancient and Modern Chronologers, except Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> and two or three others, affirm to be written before?</p>
               <p>It is very evident that the Holy Ghoſt appoints the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> the ſole Biſhops of the Church, when <hi>Paul</hi> bid them a final Farewel: And is it as evident that an Evangeliſt, as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, may be degraded from an extraordinary unfixed Officer, to an ordinary fixed Paſtor?</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Eſtabliſhment of Presbytery,</hi> without a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Biſhop, it is obſervable, that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>Apoſtolical Divine Eſtabliſhment;</hi> the Apoſtle was guided by the Holy Ghoſt in his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59622:68"/>2. It was the <hi>laſt Eſtabliſhment</hi> which he intended to make in that Church, for he had no thoughts of ſeeing them again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was intended for <hi>a perpetual Eſtabliſhment,</hi> not only in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but in all other Churches. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> allows the Government of this Church to be a Plat-form for other Churches, <hi>p.</hi> 45. That it was Perpetual appears, 1. Becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gave them his <hi>laſt Thoughts,</hi> which are the ſame with his <hi>dying Thoughts,</hi> for he poſitively tells them, He ſhou'd ſee their Faces no more. 2. Here is not one Circumſtance in the whole Context that makes for a <hi>Temporary Eſtabliſhment.</hi> If any ſay it was <hi>Temporary,</hi> he ought to prove it. We may with much better Reaſon affirm, That the appointing of <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangeliſt, to ſettle ſome things in <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s abſence was <hi>Temporary.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not give the leaſt hint in his whole Diſcourſe with the Epheſian Elders of any Biſhop he had ſet over them, or that he intended to ſet one hereafter. It's certain <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs know what ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God would have ſettled in his Church after his departure. We cannot imagine that he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the <hi>Pattern of God's Houſe.</hi> The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts of the Spirit were not given them in vain, it was to lead them into all Truth. Now if the Apoſtle knew of this pretended future Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of Epiſcopacy, how comes he not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Presbyters, with it? He ſhou'd have told them how they were to Govern the Church in Subordination to their Biſhop, <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>future.</hi> But not a word of all this in his whole Diſcourſe, A certain evidence that it was the Apoſtle's mind, and the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhou'd Govern the Church in common.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> was now preſent, or not far off, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.4, 6.—Why had not the Apoſtle recommended the Presbyters to his charge? They wanted a preſent Biſhop, according to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Hypotheſis, for the Apoſtle was taking his final leave of them. What ſhou'd hinder his being ſet over them? His Years?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59622:68"/>He was but Young when the firſt Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which ſuppoſes him Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. There were Prophecies concerning him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. He had been Ordain'd by Prophecy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And was there no Prophecy of his being future Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus?</hi> If there was, how comes the Apoſtle to ſuppreſs it, in this neceſſary Juncture, when it ſo greatly concern'd the Epheſian Elders to know how the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was to be Govern'd after the Apoſtle's departure? Would not the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> acquieſce in this determination of the Apoſtle, as his laſt and unalterable Settlement? 4. No reaſon can be given why this Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſhould be afterwards chang'd. The Rector thinks it was done as a <hi>Remedy against the Schiſms,</hi> p. 47. But the Eſtabliſhment of the Presbytery in <hi>Epheſus</hi> was for a Remedy againſt Schiſms, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28, 29, 30. <hi>After my departure grievous wolves ſhall enter in among you, not ſparing the flock, and of your ſelves ſhall men ariſe</hi>— This he mentions as a reaſon why the Elders of <hi>Epheſus ſhould overſee the Flock,</hi> v. 28, 31. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was appointed by the Wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt, which cannot Err in Judgment; He knows how to provide <hi>apt and effectual Remedies.</hi> He is in one Mind, and does not appoint that to day which he repents of to morrow; His Proviſions are not <hi>meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prudential,</hi> like thoſe of Men's deviſing, to whom future Events are wrapt up in obſcurity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon tryal of their aptneſs to the ends for which they were deſign'd, change their thoughts concerning them, and take new meaſures. It is not ſo with the All-wiſe God, He ſees the End in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and Effects in their Cauſes, and with Him is no <hi>variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let's hear what the <hi>Rector</hi> can ſay for the Change of this Government by Presbyters, ſettled in the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He Promiſes to Treat of three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Plantation and Government of the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>by</hi> Paul, <hi>ſo long as he was in a condition to manage the Affairs of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59622:69"/>2. <hi>He'll ſhew the laſt Orders he took about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>in his abſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He'll give us the glory of it, unto the Writing of</hi> Ignatius<hi>'s Epistles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, we agree with him, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were Subject to <hi>Paul,</hi> and good reaſon for it, for he was an Apoſtle infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>He obſerves two Things from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.1. <hi>That the Apoſtle committed the Government of this Church, in his abſence, unto theſe Presbyters (or Biſhops) for I'll ſuppoſe at preſent, that the Title and Power of Biſhops belong'd to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Here's a plain acknowledgment of our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, That the Government of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Church was devolv'd upon the Presbyters there, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates as if this was only for a time, <hi>i. e. during his abſence;</hi> whereas the Apoſtle intended to ſee their Faces no more; ſo that his <hi>Abſence was to be perpetual,</hi> (as to his preſent Intention at leaſt) and conſequently the <hi>Power committed to theſe Presbyters was perpetual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2, He ſeems loath to call them <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but is ſo kind as to <hi>ſuppoſe it at preſent,</hi> though the Holy Ghoſt expreſly calls them ſo, and made them ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Feed the ſtock, over which the Holy Ghost made you</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> He obſerves from this Scripture,<note place="margin">p. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>certainly fore-ſaw, that Schiſms would ariſe among them.</hi> He did ſo, and provided a Remedy againſt them, by committing the Government there to the Presbyters. <hi>If Dioceſan Epiſcopacy</hi> had been the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, how comes the Apoſtle not to mention it at this time? He makes mention of the Diſeaſe, <hi>v.</hi> 29. as he confeſſeth, and why not of the Remedy alſo, neither here, nor in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians?</hi> which he obſerves was written <hi>to give a check to their Schiſms,</hi> chap. 4. That Epiſtle and <hi>Chapter</hi> mentions the ſeveral degrees of Miniſters in Chriſt's Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 11. but not a word of a Biſhop, <hi>as the Center of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the whole Epistle.</hi> Nor does
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59622:69"/>he require <hi>one ordinary Minister to obey another,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Epiſtle, or that to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were <hi>peſter'd with Schiſms alſo,</hi> as he takes notice. If Biſhops had been the Remedy, the Apoſtle would not have omitted mentioning them, having ſuch proper occaſion given him, and writing deſignedly to them upon that Subject. We would reckon him but a ſorry Phyſician that would preſcribe ſeveral Remedies for a Diſtemper, and omit the <hi>onely proper Remedy.</hi> Such a Spiritual Phyſician the <hi>Rector</hi> makes the Apoſtle to be: <hi>He</hi> (ſays he) <hi>foreſaw the Schiſms of the Epheſians, wrote an Epiſtle to unite them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>and has a warm Diſcouaſe about <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>And wrote another to the Corinthians to cure their Diviſions.</hi> But has not ſo much as touch'd upon his proper Remedy of Dioceſan Biſhops. There is a like warm Exhortation to Unity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. and yet that Church was Governed by <hi>Biſhops and Deacons, Phil.</hi> 1.1. and not by one <hi>Superiour Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second thing he promis'd was to tell us,<note place="margin">P. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>The Order he took afterwards about the Government of the Church of</hi> Epheſus, which was this: <hi>The Apoſtle being ſet at liberty, and returning back from</hi> Italy <hi>to the Eaſt, and being now old,</hi> Phil. v. 9. <hi>and finding that Factions and Diviſions every where increas'd and prevail'd, Conſtituted</hi> Timothy <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>(as doubtleſs he did the ſame in all other places)</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He takes it for granted the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written after <hi>Paul</hi>'s Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I deny. We ſhall hear his Proofs in the next Chapter, which we will there conſider.</p>
               <p>If he be miſtaken in this Point of Chronology, as I ſhall prove he is. then all his Reaſonings from this Epiſtle fall to the ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There were <hi>Factions and Diviſions</hi> in the Churches long before, as he himſelf confeſſeth, and as is apparent from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Why had not the Apoſtle provided this Remedy ſooner, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the <hi>increaſe and prevalence</hi> of them? A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is eaſier prevented than cured <hi>If Diviſions increaſed</hi> under the Government of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59622:70"/>was the new Order of Biſhops like to put a ſtop to them? Why is this then aſſign'd as the Reaſon of the Inſtitution?</p>
               <p n="3">3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. Does not ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> It is agreed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle was at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and reſided there for a conſiderable time after St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure thence, and after the Writing of the Firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſe. Hiſt. Eccl. <hi>III. 17.</hi> al. <hi>18.</hi> Iren. adv. Haer. <hi>III. 3</hi> Hierom. Catal. Scrip. Eccl.</note> 
                  <hi>Euſebius,</hi> upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> affirms that he return'd to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> after he was releas'd from his Baniſhment at <hi>Patmos,</hi> and lived there, and among the other <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches until <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Days. His ordinary Reſidence was at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> &amp;c. affirm.</p>
               <p>If St. <hi>John</hi> kept his Reſidence at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Church (as he did other Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>) by his Apoſtolical Power, <hi>Timothy</hi> could not be the Supreme Ruler of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Where an Apoſtle was Preſent and Reſident to Govern, his Superiour Authority Suſpended all Epiſcopal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; ſo that according to the Rector's own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, there was no need of a Biſhop, while an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle could Overſee the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He gives not the leaſt Proof that <hi>Paul made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in all other Places. Doubtleſs it was ſo</hi> (ſaith he) you muſt take his <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> for Proof, and then all your Doubts will vaniſh.</p>
               <p>He confeſſes that the Apoſtle <hi>might juſtly Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Commend</hi> Timothy.<note place="margin">P. 49.</note> The Scope of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter was to prove the <hi>Presbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Apoſtles,</hi> and therefore were not Supreme Governours: Now he owns <hi>Timothy</hi> to be Subject to the Apoſtle. So that his Argument, that the Preſbyters had no Power of Government, becauſe Subject to the Apoſtles, is thrown out of Doors by himſelf. Had he been ſo kind as to inſert this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in its proper place, he would have ſpared us the trouble of ſeveral Remarks upon the former Chapter.</p>

Did he leave <hi>Succeſſors with the ſame extraordinary Powers?</hi> If Evangeliſts, one Species of extraordinary Officers, have Succeſſors, why ſhould not <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> alſo, have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors aſſigned them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apostles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> were alike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and Superiour to Paſtors and Teachers, the ordinary Officers of Chriſt's Church. No rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why one ſort of extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſhould be continued, more than the reſt which are confeſſedly <hi>ceas'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let's hear his Proofs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was no ways likely but that</hi> Timothy <hi>was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Impower'd by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to provide for the future Government of the Church; and perhaps his Commiſſion is in that</hi> (2 Tim. 2.2.) <hi>or if not, yet he would of his own accord ſettle it upon the ſame bottom, that himſelf had received it from the Apoſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something he would ſay, but knows not what. I expected a clear Proof, but we are put off with a perhaps it was ſo, or ſo, or ſo, one way or other it muſt be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's likely he was Impower'd to provide for the future Government of the Church. Paul</hi> provided for it in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Commiſſion in</hi> 1 Tim. 22.11. <hi>is to commit the things that he had heard of</hi> Paul <hi>to faithful Men, which ſhould be able to Teach others alſo.</hi> Is this a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59622:71"/>to Ordain Biſhops? Are all <hi>Teachers</hi> Biſhops? The Biſhops in <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20.28. are but meer Teachers with him, and now the Teachers in <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> are Ordaining Biſhops. The <hi>Biſhops which the Holy Ghost made</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he degrades into <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Teachers,</hi> who have no Ordaining Power; and now when it ſerves his turn, he advances the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Ordained by <hi>Timothy,</hi> into the Order of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Timothy <hi>would of his own accord ſettle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as he received it.</hi> He received the Power of an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> which was Temporary, as was that of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Timothy</hi> left a Succeſſor,<note place="margin">P. 56.</note> becauſe <hi>Chriſt directs his Meſſage to the Angel of the Church in the ſingular Number; if that Church had been Govern'd by a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, the Meſſage muſt have been Expreſs'd in the Plural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Angel is a Metaphorical Term,</hi> and is generally applied to the Heavenly Spirits, which are <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Spirits to the Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14, So that this Title denotes a Miniſtry rather than Degrees of Superiority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Angel is often taken collectively, and ſeldom perſonally, in the Myſterious <hi>Book of the Revelation, Rev.</hi> 9.11. &amp; 14.6, 8, 9. And ſo are Stars uſed, which are the ſame <hi>with Angels, Rev.</hi> 1.20. &amp; 12.1. &amp; 8.10. &amp; 9.1. They are <hi>Mystical Terms,</hi> and no clear Conſequence can be deduced from them. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> in his Diſputations with the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> excepts againſt Myſtical, Figurative Scriptures, and requires ſome clear Texts that carry their own Evidence with them<note n="*" place="margin">Haec My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica ſunt, opertaſunt, Figurata ſunt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtum quod inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete non egeat ſtagitamus.

               <p>The Epiſtles were Dedicated to all the Churches <hi>as well as to the Angels,</hi> and by the ſame reaſon muſt be directed to all the Miniſters, as well as to one. Can it be imagined that the Spirit ſhould ſpeak to all the Churches, and not to all the Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There were ſeveral <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20.28. and doubtleſs all of them were concerned in Chriſt's Meſſage, though it might be directed to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59622:71"/>one, as Preſident or Moderator, for Order's ſake. But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will never be able to prove, that one Angel had <hi>Juriſdiction over the reſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If there were any thing of certainty in the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Hierarchy,</hi> which is deſcribed by the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Order of Angels (ſtrictly call'd ſo) is the loweſt of all the reſt<note n="*" place="margin">Extremo loco inter Coelestes Eſſentias Angelicam proprietam obtinent. <hi>De Coel. Hierar. Cap. 9.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>How comes that to be the higheſt Order among Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Angels, which is the loweſt among Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Argels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds the Reaſon, <hi>why 'tis ſaid Angel in the ſingular Number, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there was an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion current in thoſe Days, that every Province had his peculiar Guardian Angel,</hi> Deut. 32.8. in the LXX, Dan. 12.1. &amp; 10.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The current Opinion of a <hi>Provincial Guardian Angel</hi> is very doubtful at the beſt, and without Foundation in the Scriptures he quotes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Seventy Interpreters render <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. <hi>He ſet the bounds of the People accordirg to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Angels of God;</hi> whereas according to the Hebrew it ſhould be, <hi>according to the number of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.

               <p n="3">3. According to this Alluſion the Rector would have the Holy Ghoſt to conſtitute but one <hi>Biſhop for one Province,</hi> or Nation, and but Seventy for all the Nations of the World.

               <p>This was the Primitive Biſhop, as <hi>J. O.</hi> hath proved in his Plea (p. 136. 139.) out of <hi>Hilarius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Biſhop was but the chief Paſtor of a Church that ordinarily Aſſembled together for Perſonal Communion, as will appear to any Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Perſon that Reads theſe Epiſtles with Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Here is not one Direction or Command given to the Presbytery,<note place="margin">P. 76.</note> nor any ſhare in the Government commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them in theſe Epiſtles,</hi> ſaith our Author.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Epiſtles were directed to <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> who were ſuperiour to Presbyters; and therefore it was fit the Exhortation ſhould be immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Directions concern'd the Presbyters alſo, as the ordinary perpetual Governours of the Church; and doubtleſs were intended for the uſe of the Church unto the end of time, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The Presbyters are concern'd, I hope, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Directions to Purity, Patience, Conſtancy, Faithfulneſs in diſpenſing the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 6.11, 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. and 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a very groſs miſtake, that the <hi>Presbytery had no ſhare in the Government communicated to them in theſe Epiſtles. Paul</hi> ordain'd <hi>Biſhops there,</hi> who among other Qualifications muſt be ſuch as <hi>Rul'd well</hi> their own Houſes, that they might <hi>take care</hi> of the Church of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4, 5. And in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. he mentions <hi>Elders</hi> that <hi>Ruled well, and mere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Double Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He contradicts himſelf, and ſaith, that <hi>the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had ſome Intereſt in the Government, (tho' their Power was ſubordinate) as appears from the Council at</hi> Jeruſalem,<note place="margin">P. 77.</note> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>even with the Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; doubtleſs then, and much more with <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> They had no ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet they had ſome Intereſt in it; himſelf can beſt reconcile theſe inconſiſtent Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>They were ſubordinate to the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and ſo were the Evangeliſts: But can he produce
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59622:75"/>any ordinary Presbyters, that were ſubordinate to others of the ſame Order?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>allows 'em a great ſtroke in</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Affairs <hi>of their Churches,</hi>

                  <hi>but still in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Biſhop, without whom they</hi> could do nothing.</p>
               <p>It does not appear that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Biſhop could do any thing without his Presbyters, no more than they could without him. And long after his time, the Biſhop had no power to determine Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without his Presbyters; as appears by that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> — <q>Let the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hear no Mans Cauſe without the Preſence of his Clergy; otherwiſe his <hi>Sentence ſhall be void, unleſs it be confirmed by the preſence of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>

               <p>By theſe and many other Paſſages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles, it's evident that the Biſhop and Presbyters ſat in Council together, and were only the Guides of a <hi>Parochial Church,</hi> in which the Biſhop did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his Presbyters, nor they without him. This Agreement of the Biſhop and his Presbyters; <hi>Ignatius</hi> compares to the <hi>Strings of a Harp;</hi> and adds, That under their joynt Conduct the whole

               <p>As to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> I will add theſe few things, and ſo conclude this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certain there was an Order of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. This all will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſixed Officers,</hi> ſubordinate to the Apoſtles, and ſent by them to ſupply their abſence, in the Churches planted by them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. Not as their <hi>ſtated Paſtors,</hi> for they had Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers reſident with them; but to guide the New
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59622:76"/>Paſtors in Faith, Worſhip and Diſcipline, during the preſent Neceſſity, until the Canon of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were written for a compleat and infallible <hi>Directory</hi> unto all Churches unto the end of Time. The Apoſtles themſelves could not be every where, and the ordinary Miniſters would be often at a loſs without their Directions. Therefore it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſhould entruſt ſome Perſons, as Delegates, to go in their names, and with full inſtructions to the Churches, to ſettle, direct and eſtabliſh them.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> generally attended the Apoſtles, that they might be aſſiſtant to them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they ſend them to one Church, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to another, to make a ſhorter or a longer ſtay, as the circumſtances of their work required, and then to return again to the Apoſtle that ſent them.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſent to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10. &amp; 4.17. we find him with <hi>Paul</hi> again, when he writ the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. at <hi>Berea</hi> he was with <hi>Paul,</hi> and abode there ſtill with <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 17.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as he did afterwards at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>I beſought thee,</hi>

                  <hi>to abide ſtill,</hi> but no more as Biſhop of Epheſus than of <hi>Berea.</hi> And yet this is the great Argument to prove him Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> beſought him to abide there. It's true, he ſoon left <hi>Berea,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17.15. whoſe companion he was: Nor was he to ſtay at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but until <hi>Paul</hi> came to him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. &amp; 4.13. And in the ſecond Epiſtle, which was written not long after the firſt, the Apoſtle calls him away to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſends <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus,</hi> another Evangeliſt to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9.12.21. In 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1. we find him in <hi>Athens,</hi> whence he was ſent to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and thence returned back to <hi>Athens,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1, 2, 6. After this he remov'd with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Corinth, Acts</hi> 18.5. thence he accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 19.1. thence he was ſent to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> v. 21, 22. But it were tedious to follow him in all his Travels to ſo many diſtant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p n="3">3. Evangeliſts were ſubordinate to the Apoſtles, and ſuperiour to Preſbyters, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. They were the Apoſtles Collegues and Companions, and their Authorized Meſſengers to the Churches, to ſet in order what was wanting in them, and to inſtruct, admoniſh and reprove the Preſbyters, as there was occaſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They had power to Ordain Miniſters where there was need of them. This appears in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who ſaith of them, <q>That travelling far from home, they perform'd the Office of Evangeliſts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl. Hist.</hi> III. 31.</note> and preached Chriſt to ſuch as heard not of the Faith, and delivered unto them the Scriptures of the holy Goſpels with great application. When they had laid the foundation of Chriſtian Doctrine in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtrange places, and ordained other Paſtors, and committed the new Converts to their Care and Conduct, they went into other Countries and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, attended with the favour and power of God.</q> Thus he. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who were both of them Evangeliſts, were entruſted with the power of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, We have already proved, That ordinary Preſbyters have exerciſed this power, much more might Evangeliſts, who were extraordinary Officers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Evangeliſts were Temporary Officers in tho Church, and are long ſince ceas'd, as <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Evangeliſts, as we have prov'd, and therefore no <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> It would
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59622:77"/>be a degrading an extraordinary Officer, whoſe Power was general over all the Churches, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the Apoſtles, to make an ordinary Officer of him, and to confine his Power to one particular Church. It's like the Degrading of the Colonel of a Regiment, to be the Captain of a ſingle Company; or the Confining of a <hi>Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> to a mean <hi>Parochial Cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and ſome Others, will own they were <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and Unfixed at firſt, but that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle towards his latter End had made them Biſhops, and that they were ſuch when he wrote his Epiſtles to them, which was after his firſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome:</hi> This he undertakes to prove in his next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>ONE and the leading Argument for</hi> Timothy<hi>'s being Biſhop of</hi> Epheſus,<note place="margin">P. 79.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith he, is grounded on</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. <hi>I beſought thee to abide ſtill at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>when I went to</hi> Macedonia.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59622:78"/>1. To abide ſtill, doth not imply a continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence. <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to abide ſtill at <hi>Berea,</hi> where he made but a ſhort ſtay, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.14, 15. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will as ſoon prove him Biſhop of <hi>Berea,</hi> as Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſtay there was but ſhort, that is, until the Apoſtle came to him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. and 4.13. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> himſelf allows in p. 90. That <hi>the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>was Govern'd by Presbyters under</hi> Paul, <hi>whilſt he was vigorous and active, and had opportunity to overſee both the Flock and the Elders themſelves.</hi> The Apoſtle was vigorous and active when he writ this firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and he intended ſhortly to viſit the Flock and Elders of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Therefore by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <hi>Timothy</hi> could not be Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> when that Epiſtle was written.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was not fixed as Reſident at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for the Apoſtle afterwards calls him to <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9, 21. and ſends Tychicus the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> to <hi>Epheſus.</hi> We do not read that <hi>Timothy</hi> ever return'd to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Weakneſs of his <hi>Leading Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as he calls it, by which we may judge of the reſt.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>That the Diſſenters, to avoid the Argument built upon</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. <hi>and the reſt of the Epiſtle, ſay, That the firſt Epiſtle to</hi> Timothy <hi>was written before the Meeting at</hi> Miletus, <hi>in which the Apoſtle committed the Flock to the Elders of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and not to</hi> Timothy, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28.</p>
               <p>Our Argument from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. holds good, tho' that Epiſtle ſhould be written after, as we have proved already in <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not the Diſſenters only (as he unfairly ſuggeſts) that ſay that this Epiſtle was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Meeting at <hi>Miletus;</hi> It's the general and prevailing Opinion of the greateſt part of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, Ancient and Modern, the moſt Learned Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of Epiſcopacy not excepted.

               <p>The <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> were ſenſible that this Opinion was prejudicial to the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay, tho' not poſitively, That the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Timothy, was written after</hi> Paul's <hi>firſt Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment at</hi> Rome, <hi>when he was ſet at Liberty</hi>

               </p>
               <p>One that had not read Biſhop <hi>Pearſon,</hi> would think the <hi>Rector</hi> very ingenuous in acknowledging that he is beholden to the Biſhop for what he pretends to ſay on <hi>Paul</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> mentioned in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Miracle of his Time</hi> (ſaith he,<note place="margin">p. 80.</note> meaning Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi>) <hi>in his</hi> Annales Paulini, <hi>has given us a plain Account and Proof thereof: All that I pretend unto is, to build on his Foundation, and to enlarge on what that excellent Prelate has demonſtrated, in a few words.</hi> Thus the Rector.</p>
               <p>I will not diſpute whether the Learned Biſhop were <hi>the Miracle of his Time;</hi> if he were, Miracles are grown very Common in this laſt Age, for the Biſhop had many Equals, whoſe Learned Works are nothing inferiour to his.</p>
               <p>I dare affirm that our Rector is no <hi>Miracle in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi> for he builds very ſorrily on the Biſhops Foundation. Inſtead of raiſing a Superſtructure, he has rather diſturbed the Foundation; The Learned Biſhop diſcourſes diſtinctly and clearly, the Rector confuſedly and darkly.</p>
               <p>He refers to Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi>'s <hi>Annales Paulini,</hi> and pretends to enlarge on what the Biſhop had demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated <hi>in few words;</hi> but takes no notice of the Biſhops enlarging on that Argument in his <hi>Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whence he borrow'd what he pretends to ſay on <hi>Paul</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> but would have his Reader believe the Enlargements are his own. See

               <p>But let's conſider what the Rector has to offer out of Dr. <hi>Pearſon.</hi> Thus he goes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Characteriſtick of the preciſe time of <hi>Paul</hi>'s beſeeching <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is ſet down by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">P. 80.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. When I went into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia:</hi> This was not, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> at any of thoſe times of <hi>Paul</hi>'s going into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> remembred in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and therefore it was after the Apoſtle bad the <hi>Epheſians</hi> farewel at <hi>Miletus.</hi>
                  </q> Here he ſpends ſeveral Pages to ſhew it was none of the times mention'd by St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Tho' <hi>Luke</hi> doth not mention (in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.) <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s being left at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it is enough that <hi>Paul</hi> mentions it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. In <hi>Acts</hi> 19.21.22. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends <hi>Timothy</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> appointing him to call at <hi>Corinth</hi> by the way, and intends himſelf to ſtay at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> until he ſhould come thither again to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10, 11. He chargeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <q>Conduct him forth in Peace, that he might come to him, for he looked for him with the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</q> It's moſt likely then, he return'd from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> unto <hi>Paul.</hi> The diſturbance there, occaſion'd <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure before the time he had fix'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. And ſo he ſetteth for <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> as he intended, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.1.</p>
               <p>At his departure from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he leaves <hi>Timothy</hi> there behind, not as a Reſident, but in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abſence to ſupply the preſent Neceſſity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3, 4. until he return'd again, which he intended ſhortly to do, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nothing can be concluded from <hi>Luke</hi>'s ſilence in this point: for it is certain that he does not mention all the Journeys either of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 20.1, 2. he ſaith that <hi>Paul</hi> departed from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to go into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> but ſpeaks nothing of his ſtay at <hi>Troas,</hi> which tho' but ſhort, was not without ſome Succeſs: Yet this Omiſſion of <hi>Luke,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, 13. doth ſupply.</p>
               <p>Where doth <hi>Luke</hi> mention <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59622:79"/>Goſpel in <hi>Illiricum,</hi> which we are ſure he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 15.19. Nor doth he mention his preaching in <hi>Arabia,</hi> which is ſpoken of in Gal. 1.17.</p>
               <p>Nor doth <hi>Luke</hi> mention <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Journey to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to confirm them in the Faith. In <hi>Acts</hi> 17.13, 14. we find him at <hi>Berea</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who were driven from <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> by Perſecution. <hi>Paul</hi> experts him ſpeedily at <hi>Athens,</hi> verſ. 15. And we hear no more of him till <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Corinth. Acts</hi> 18.15. But what's omitted by <hi>Luke,</hi> is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was ſent to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> while <hi>Paul</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe I find <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Berea,</hi> a Town of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Acts 17.13, 14. and ſometime after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.5. Shall I therefore conclude that he was in <hi>Berea</hi> all that time? When I find <hi>Paul</hi> expecting him in <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſending him from thence to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> between thoſe times, as is mention'd by himſelf in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.1, 2. With as much reaſon may the Rector conclude, that becauſe he finds <hi>Timothy</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Acts 19.21, 22. And there again about half a year after, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.4. That therefore he was not out of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> in all that time; Tho' we find the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting him at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 16.10, 11. And lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him there, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. when he went into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</hi> He may as rationally affirm, That the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> was written after <hi>Paul</hi>'s Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> (which all acknowledge to be written before) becauſe it mentions a Journey of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> which <hi>Luke,</hi> in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> takes no notice of.</p>
               <p>As the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſupply ſome Paſſages in the Travels of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> omitted by <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> even ſo doth the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 1.3, ſupply what's omitted in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>It is uſual in all Hiſtories, for one Author to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply It what's omitted by another: And in Scripture-Hiſtory, what's omitted in the <hi>Books of Kings,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59622:80"/>in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> which are therefore call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Things omitted,</hi> by the Lxx. What's omitted by one Evangeliſt, is reported by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>So what's omitted by <hi>Luke,</hi> is mentioned by the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to wit, That he beſought him to ſtay at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. <hi>Luke</hi> no where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Titus, Paul</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Companion, whom the Apoſtle ſo often mentions in his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> after his Releaſe from his firſt Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Rome, (continues our Author)</hi> went back to viſit the Eaſtern Churches,<note place="margin">P. 87.</note> as he intended, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25, 26. <hi>and</hi> 2.24. <hi>Philem.</hi> 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.23. He went from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Crete,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Judea.</hi> In his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by <hi>Crete</hi> (which was his way by Sea to <hi>Judea</hi>) he planted a Church there: For no other time can be aſſign'd for it but this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All this is confidently affirm'd, after the <hi>Rector</hi>'s uſual way. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is no expreſs proof that he viſited the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> after his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> He might viſit the <hi>Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> without ever ſeeing <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as he had poſitively ſaid <hi>he ſhould not,</hi> Acts 20.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not certain whether he viſited the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> after his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he doth not poſitively promiſe it. He ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what would become of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.23, 24. He had ſome <hi>hopes</hi> of ſeeing them, but was not <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Philem.</hi> 22. Nay, had he paſs'd a Promiſe of ſeeing them again, it doth not neceſſarily follow he did ſee them. Many things might happen to divert his Intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it happen'd with reſpect to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he made of Viſiting the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> aſſigns another time<note n="*" place="margin">Vol. 1. p. 309.</note> for <hi>Paul</hi>'s viſiting of <hi>Crete,</hi> and that was when he return'd from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Greece, Acts</hi> 20. 2. And then he left <hi>Titus</hi> there, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. thinking that he ſhould preſently after a little ſtay in <hi>Greece,</hi> have ſet towards <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> As he was about to fall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59622:80"/>into <hi>Syria,</hi> the Jews laid wait for him, which made him to return through <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 20.3. About that time, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> conceives, he writ the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> in which he calls him to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> where he intended to winter, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.12. It is certain he winter'd in thoſe Parts, for the Spring following he ſails into <hi>Aſia, Acts</hi> 20.6. He had ſome thoughts of wintering in <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.6. But It ſeems, altering his Reſolution, he determined to winter in <hi>Nicopolis</hi> a City in <hi>Epirus,</hi> not very far diſtant from <hi>Corinth. Titus,</hi> according to appointment, came to him, and was ſent by him to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to haſten the Collection for the Saints in <hi>Judea,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.16, 17.</p>
               <p>We do not deny but St. <hi>Paul</hi> might go into <hi>Spain,</hi> and perhaps to <hi>Britain</hi> alſo, as ſome affirm, but no Man ever affirm'd ſo palpable an untruth, as that all the <hi>Fathers ſhould ſay ſo,</hi> before this man, whoſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſo crude and indigeſted,<note place="margin">P. 90.</note> that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a <hi>juſt Volume</hi> to make a Collection of them.</p>
               <p>He would make <hi>Jerom</hi> ſay, <q>That it was decreed in the Apoſtles time, that one elected out of the Preſbyters (who before Govern'd the Church in common) was ſet over the reſt,<note place="margin">P. 91, 92.</note> and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was occaſion'd by the <hi>Corinthian Schiſm.</hi>

               <p>Here he abuſes <hi>Jerom</hi> and his Reader, for <hi>Rerom</hi> no where ſaith, that the ſuperiority of Biſhops was decreed in the Apoſtles time, <hi>Jerom</hi> proves the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity</hi> of Biſhops and Preſbyters not only from the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> but from the Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> the laſt of the Apoſtles. Then he adds, <hi>quod autem postea, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>That <hi>afterwards</hi> one was choſen, and ſet over the reſt, as a Remedy againſt Schiſm.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jerom</hi>'s <hi>afterwards</hi> muſt refer to the Writing of <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle, and ſo his meaning muſt be, <hi>that after the Apoſtles time this Decree</hi> was made, for he proves that Preſbyter s and Biſhops were the ſam in the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he alludes to the <hi>Corinthian Schiſm,</hi> but it's evident, That <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> contain no ſuch Remedy againſt Schiſm, as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59622:81"/>the <hi>Superiority of Biſhops.</hi> The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm was a moſt proper occaſion for the <hi>Inſtitution of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> if they were the apteſt <hi>remedy againſt Schiſm.</hi> But there is not a word of it in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to that Church; Nor in <hi>Clemens</hi>'s his Epiſtle written long after. What he ſaith of <hi>Ignatius</hi> agreeing with <hi>Jerom</hi> in his account of Biſhops, we have conſidered before.</p>
               <p>The Rector adds, <q>That the Apoſtle was as much concern'd at the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm, as any other, and that ſeeing Diviſions ariſing every where, (not only at <hi>Corinth</hi>) he weighed the matter well, and aſk'd counſel of God, what he ſhould do. And in the end concluded, to ſet one Preſbyter over the reſt, to prevent the miſchief of Schiſm, God ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Doubtleſs the Apoſtle was concern'd at the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schiſm, as it was a diſhonour to God and Religion, but not ſo much as it was againſt <hi>him and his authority,</hi> which is the reaſon Mr. <hi>G.</hi> aſſigns: He dare not ſay, he appointed the remedy at this time, he knew that would be too groſs: But he cunningly ſaith, <hi>in the end he concluded to ſet up one Presbyter over the rest,</hi> and refers us to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>The firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Schiſms there, was written about the year of Chriſt 55, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> calculates<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>This Gentleman is ſingular at Demonſtrations; but let's ſee the ſtrength of them.</p>
               <p n="1">

               </p>
               <p>It's moſt likely that he touch'd at <hi>Miletus,</hi> when he return'd from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in Bonds to <hi>Rome;</hi> 'tis evident he intended to ſail by the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia, Acts</hi> 27.2. and might touch at <hi>Miletus</hi> (which was a part of thoſe <hi>Aſian Coaſts</hi>) tho' <hi>Luke</hi> doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it.

               <p>But if this <hi>Miletum</hi> be <hi>Malta</hi> (antiently <hi>Melita</hi>)as <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> affirm, 'tis certain <hi>Paul</hi> was there in his Voyage from <hi>Judea</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> Acts 28.1. and might leave <hi>Trophimus</hi> ſick behind him, as he ſaith he did, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.20.</p>

               <p>I thought a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> which he promis'd us, made things <hi>very plain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>That which will put the matter out of all queſtion, is, the vaſt difference between that his Impriſonment, in <hi>Acts</hi> 28. and that in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He was in little or no danger, but held <hi>Liberâ Custodià,</hi> in his firſt Confinement; but in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he was a cloſe Priſoner, in Chains, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen the Invalidity of his <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi> as he calls them; and how improbable his <hi>Conjectures</hi> are, (which paſs for <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> with him) that the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Congreſs at <hi>Miletus,</hi> and after <hi>Paul</hi>'s Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the farther ſatisfaction of the Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I will vindicate the <hi>Ancient Chronologers,</hi> and prove that the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently before that Meeting at <hi>Miletus,</hi> in which the Apoſtle commits the Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to the Presbyters thereof, and not to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> their pretended Biſhop; and if he was no Biſhop when that Epiſtle was written, he was none at all. If that Epiſtle was writ before the Meeting at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi> all the Arguments from that Epiſtle to prove him Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> are impertinent: For the Government of that Church was committed to the Presbyters in common, and not to <hi>Timothy</hi> who was an Evangeliſt, and not the fixed ordinary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of any one Church, Acts 20.17, 28. 2 Tim. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59622:82"/>That <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and wrote his Firſt Epiſtle to him, before his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> appears,</p>

               <p>This Excommunication was not long after his Apoſtacy, as we may rationally ſuppoſe, and ſo is mention'd as a late thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>

               <p n="1">1.

For the ſame reaſon he ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Let no Man deſpiſe thy Youth.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.11.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe <hi>Timothy</hi> was about 24 or 25 Years old when <hi>Paul</hi> took him into the Miniſtry, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.34. which was about the Year of Chriſt, LI.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lightf.</hi> Vol. 1. p. 294.</note>; from this time to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Second Bonds and Martyrdom, (which happen'd <hi>A.

               <p>Therefore he wrote this Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> many Years before his laſt Confinement, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his firſt Bonds, when <hi>Timothy</hi> was indeed a young Man, about 33, or 34, or perhaps Younger, not much Elder than when he wrote <hi>his firſt Epiſtle</hi> to him, in which he ſaith, <hi>let no man deſpiſe thy youth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. Or when he ſent his Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (which all confeſs to be Penn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his firſt Bonds) that chargeth them not <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him</hi> for the ſame Reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.11<note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

               <p>For the ſame Reaſon he calls him Son, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends for <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9. His Letter finds him ſome where near <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. &amp; 1.16, 18. &amp; 4.13. Accordingly <hi>Timothy</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59622:83"/>came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and it doth not appear that he came thither before this time that he was ſent for. The laſt mention we have of him in the <hi>Acts</hi> is, That he accompanies <hi>Paul</hi> into <hi>Aſia, Acts</hi> 20.4. We read nothing of him in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore 'tis moſt likely, he parted with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Miletus,</hi> and ſtaid among the <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> until he was ſent for by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> After his coming thither, the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> and <hi>Philemon,</hi> were written, for his Name is Prefixed to them, as well as <hi>Paul</hi>'s: Now theſe Epiſtles were written in his Firſt Bonds at <hi>Rome, Phil.</hi> 1.26. &amp; 2.23, 24. <hi>Philemon.</hi> 22. This will not be deny'd: therefore the Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written in his firſt Bonds, though ſometime before theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Timothy</hi> is deſir'd to bring <hi>Mark</hi> with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11.

               <p n="4">4. He mentions, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.11. his Sufferings which befel him at <hi>Ieonium,</hi> at <hi>Lyſtra</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> of which we have an account in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. Now this Perſecution happen'd about the Year of Chriſt, 49, or 50<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Second Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> was in the Year of Chriſt 68, or as others, 69, which was the Year in which he wrote this Epiſtle, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this new <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> So that his Perſecutions at <hi>Antioch, Lyconium,</hi> and <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> were near 20 years before his laſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> Now it is not likely that the Apoſtle would mention an Event ſo long paſt, when there were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> other latter Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his that were much freſher in his Memory.</p>
               <p>Therefore we may rather think, that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59622:84"/>his Sufferings at <hi>Antioch, &amp;c.</hi> as a late thing, not very many Yeats paſt, and if ſo, this Second Epiſtle was written much earlier than is pretended.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> was written in <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Bonds, (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> confeſſeth, p. 86, 87.) and was ſent by <hi>Tychicus, Eph.</hi> 6.21. who was alſo the Bearer of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians, Col.</hi> 4.7. which was written at the ſame time with that to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as he obſerveth, <hi>p.</hi> 87. <hi>Tychicus</hi> had gone along with <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 20.5. This ſending of <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Epheſus</hi> is mention'd in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. Therefore this Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which mentions this Journey of <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was written about the ſame time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is agreed by all, That <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſet at Liberty in his laſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> but he was delivered from the Confinement mention'd in the Second Epiſtle to <hi>Tim.</hi> Chap. 4.17. Therefore that Epiſtle was not written in his laſt Bonds. <hi>He was delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion, that all the Gentiles might hear the</hi> Goſpel. That is, that he might go about, and preach the Goſpel to many Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>This is agreeable to the account that the Fathers give of his Preaching the Goſpel to ſeveral Nations after his Impriſonment. Hence it's evident, ſaith <hi>Estius</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Est. in Loc.</note> That this Epiſtle <hi>was not written in</hi> Paul<hi>'s Last Bonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It is undeniable that <hi>Luke</hi> accompanied <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 27. &amp; 28. He includes himſelf all along in the Narrative he gives of their dangerous Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpeaks in the firſt Perſon plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.16. <hi>When we came to Rome.</hi> He was at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> which was written in his Firſt Bonds, as is confeſs'd, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.14. And ſo he was when <hi>Paul</hi> ſent the Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. Therefore this Epiſtle was Penn'd during his Firſt Bonds.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He mentions his <hi>Cloak, &amp;c.</hi> which he left at <hi>Troas</hi> with <hi>Carpus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. Theſe were left
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59622:84"/>there, as it ſeems, as he was going among his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Judea, Acts</hi> 20.16. where he had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his <hi>Roman Habit,</hi> which might have proved inconvenient in <hi>Judea,</hi> among his own Countrey-Men, who were too much prejudiced againſt him already, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. and to whom he was deſirous to render himſelf acceptable by all Lawful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.26. But now he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had need of his <hi>Roman Garb,</hi> which was the <hi>Pallium,</hi> or Cloak. There is no Evidence of his paſſing by <hi>Troas</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> in his laſt Journey thither, nor can any reaſon be given why he ſhould leave his Cloak there, as he went to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Roman Colonies:</hi> but it looks Rational enough that he ſhould do ſo, when he was going into <hi>Judea,</hi> and that he ſhould ſend for it in his firſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he was carried Priſoner from <hi>Judea.</hi> And therefore this Second Epiſtle was Written in his firſt Bonds.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It ſhould ſeem he was under a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, when he writ the Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> for he mentions only one Chain, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. and ſo doth <hi>Luke,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 28.20. which ſpeaks of his firſt and favourable Confinement, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.20. In his Second Impriſonment he was more ſeverely handled, as all agree. Now ſuch as were in ſtrict Cuſtody were bound with <hi>two</hi> Chains, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.6. Hence it ſhould ſeem to follow, that this Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which ſpeaks but of one Chain, was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Firſt Impriſonment, which was more favourable than the Second.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Demas</hi> was with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Firſt Impriſonment, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.14. but the tediouſneſs of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Confinement, and the <hi>love of this preſent world,</hi> which is inconſiſtent with patient Suffering, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to forſake the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. We read nothing of his being there in his Second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, but we are ſure he was there in <hi>his firſt Impriſonment,</hi> and that he left him <hi>in his Bonds,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. which we may rationally conclude were his <hi>firſt Bonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not mention <hi>Paul</hi>'s leaving <hi>Trophimus</hi> at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus</hi>

               <p>Theſe Reaſons put together, may be ſufficient to ſatisfie any unbiaſs'd Man (for nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Prejudiced and Intereſſed Perſons) that the Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was Written in <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Bonds, and therefore his Firſt Epiſtle muſt be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before his Firſt Bonds, when he was in <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or thereabouts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.1, 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs any will ſay, That his Second Epiſtle was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Firſt.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable that this Epiſtle has <hi>more Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> and all <hi>concurring,</hi> of the Time in which it was written, than any one of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, the Holy Ghoſt ſo ordering the Matter, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſuch as are willing to receive the Truth.</p>
               <p>There is one Paſſage in this Epiſtle, which hath occaſioned ſome Doubt about the time of it, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. <hi>I am now ready to be offer'd, and the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> Which ſome have underſtood of his approaching Martyrdom. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59622:86"/>But yet he did not expect to dye very ſuddenly, for he ſends a Letter from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> at, or near <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to deſire him to come to him, <hi>before Winter,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.21. It wou'd require a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time to ſend a Letter from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and for <hi>Timothy</hi> to return from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to take <hi>Mark</hi> with him, who it ſhould ſeem was at <hi>Corinth:</hi> all this could not be done under three or four Months, and perhaps a longer time, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Winds that were neceſſary for ſuch a Voyage.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Paul</hi> been under a Sentence of Death at this time, he could not have made an appointment for <hi>Timothy</hi> to come unto him at a diſtant time. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in conſtant Expectations of Death, do not uſe to make appointments for a remote Time to come.</p>
               <p>Thus we have Vindicated the Ancient and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion, That the Firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was Written before <hi>Paul</hi>'s Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> and have alſo proved that the Second Epiſtle to him was Written in his Firſt Bonds; and therefore the Journey to <hi>Macedonia</hi> mention'd in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. muſt be that in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Our Argument then holds good, That <hi>Timothy was no Biſhop of Epheſus,</hi> becauſe he was no Biſhop there when the Firſt Epiſtle was Written to him, for <hi>Paul</hi> commits the whole Government of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> unto the Preſbyters of it, after the Writing of that Epiſtle, and at a time when <hi>Timothy</hi> was preſent, or not far off. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.4.17, 18—28. And when the Apoſtle <hi>knew he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee their faces more,</hi> Acts 20.25.</p>
               <p>To this laſt Scripture the <hi>Rector</hi> oppoſeth two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He Corrects the Tranſlation, and ſaith it ſhould be rendred — <hi>I know that ye ſhall no more ſee my face all of you;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 107.</note> — <hi>'tis in no wiſe probable that all of them ſaw his face any more, Death, and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties would doubtleſs hinder it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Elders,</hi> to whom he ſpake thoſe Words, we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59622:86"/>may preſume underſtood <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Rector. <hi>They all wept ſore, and ſorrow'd most of all for the Words which he ſpake,</hi> that they ſhould ſee his Face no more, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.37, 38. The Words <hi>All of you</hi> are here omitted, which ſpoils the <hi>Parſon</hi>'s gloſs. It cannot be imagin'd they wou'd all have wept ſo paſſionately, had they expected to have ſeen him again. It's Pity but our <hi>Critical Author</hi> had been there to explain <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate their ill grounded ſorrow, by telling them, <hi>they ſhou'd ſee his Face again,</hi> tho perhaps ſome of them might Dye before he came again. But he himſelf is ſenſible of the impertinency of this <hi>new Criticiſm,</hi> and therefore adds that he will <hi>not inſiſt on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 108.</note> 
                  <hi>he knew they ſhou'd ſee his Face no more, 'tis to be underſtood of a conjectural Knowledge only, as he ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is enough to confirm our Argument, that <hi>he thought</hi> he ſhou'd ſee their Faces no more, 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable he had no Hopes of ſeeing them again, and wou'd not be wanting to ſettle the Government of this Church at this Time: And it is as undeniable, he ſettled the Government in the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and not in a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> Acts 20.17, 28.</p>
               <p>The Aſſertors of Epiſcopacy, and among others, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, <q>That the Apoſtles ſettled the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Biſhops, when they were leaving the Churches, and could not overſee them any longer: This was the Caſe here.</q> The Apoſtle is leaving the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> without any thoughts of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again, and at this Time commits the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church to the Presbyters. Nor was this Conſtitution Temporary or Prudential, but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> Acts 20.17, 28. It was an appointment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Take heed to your ſelves and the ſtock,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>over which the Holy Ghoſt made you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to feed the Church of God,</hi> but of this we have ſpoken before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not uſe to expreſs himſelf <hi>ſo poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> when he ſpeaks <hi>conjecturally.</hi> It wou'd look like
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59622:87"/>raſhneſs, if not worſe, in any of us, to ſay poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I know I ſhall never ſee ſuch a Place, or People,</hi> and afterwards to excuſe it, by ſaying it was only a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural Knowledge.</hi> The Holy Apoſtle did <hi>not uſe Lightneſs in</hi> his Speech, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17, 18. he ſaith in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29. <hi>I know that grievous Wolves ſhall enter in among you.</hi> Was this alſo a <hi>conjectural Knowledge?</hi> If this was a certain Knowledge, as it is evident by the Event, it was, why ſhou'd we not underſtand, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. of a certain Knowledge?</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Form of Ordaining Prieſts,</hi> the Words are thus rendred. <hi>And now behold,</hi> I am ſure, <hi>that henceforth yea all (through whom I have gone Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God) ſhall ſee my Face no more</hi>

               <p n="4">4. It has not been yet proved that <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> after this Time. One wou'd expect a very clear Proof that he was afterwards there, from thoſe that dare Charge the Apoſtle with <hi>raſhneſs</hi> in his Expreſſions. All the Proof we have is but a <hi>qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Promiſe</hi> of viſiting <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Coloſs</hi> again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Philem.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But what is this to <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Here is not a Promiſe of ſeeing the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> again. It will be ſaid it is <hi>likely</hi> he did, I ſay, it is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did not, becauſe he himſelf ſaid, <hi>he knew he ſhou'd never ſee them again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth not poſitively Promiſe to ſee <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Coloſs</hi> again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Philem.</hi> 22. <hi>I truſt,</hi> &amp;c. Here he ſpeaks more doubtfully and not ſo poſitively as in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.25. <hi>I know,</hi> &amp;c. This Gentlemans way of arguing is very ſingular, when the Apoſtle ſpeaks doubtfully, <hi>I truſt,</hi> he is ſure he performed: But when he ſpeaks poſitively, <hi>I know,</hi> he is ſure he was miſtaken.

               </p>
               <p>I overlook his confident Triumphs, and weak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections with which he ſtuffs the concluding Pages of this Chapter, as having nothing of Argument in them, and therefore not worthy my Notice.</p>

               <p>The meaning of this Paragraph is, that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts are <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> for he makes <hi>Timothy</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> that is, the <hi>Biſhop of Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Few or none of his <hi>Judicious Brethren</hi> will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to this new Notion of <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> by which he evidently gives up the whole Cauſe. When he happens now and then to Anſwer the Title of his Book (which is <hi>Tentamen Novum</hi>) by advancing ſome <hi>New Notion,</hi> he weakly betrays the Cauſe he pretends ſtrongly to defend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He owns <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> to be a Species of <hi>Church Officers</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Paſtors and Teachers</hi> according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and conſequently he denies the <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> Biſhops to be the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of their reſpective Churches.

               <p>If he ſay they are both <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> he confounds thoſe Officers whom the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth.</p>
               <p>The Preſbyters are the <hi>Paſtors of the Flock,</hi> that is the ordinary and ſettled Rulers of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27.) Let them have this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which the Holy Ghoſt hath given them, as the <hi>proper Biſhops</hi> of the Flock, and when he hath prov'd Evangeliſts to be <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> we will readily receive them.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59622:88"/>yet he grants that an Evangeliſt, as <hi>Ravanellus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, Ordain'd Elders <hi>Oppidatim,</hi> in every Town or Village.</q>
               </p>

                  </gap>, in <hi>every City:</hi> But he wilfully overlooks that, for he knew that there were many <hi>Cities</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule that every City muſt have a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <hi>Titus</hi> muſt be <hi>Arch-biſhop of Crete:</hi> And the ſole Power of Ordination being in <hi>Titus,</hi> it would naturally follow, that none but <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> can Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. <hi>Andrew Cretentis</hi> calls him <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> and ſaith, he had twelve Biſhops under him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He cannot</hi> altogether <hi>allow Evangeliſts to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled Officers,</hi> It ſeems he does in part allow it,<note place="margin">P. 115.</note> it's too bright a Truth to be deny'd, but he endeavours to obſcure it what he can, and wou'd fain perſwade his Reader, that Evangeliſts were fixed Officers: But let's hear his Proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip was a fixed Evangeliſt, becauſe</hi> Luke <hi>leaves him at</hi> Caeſarea, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.40. <hi>And we find him there almoſt twenty Years after, having a Houſe and a ſettled Family,</hi> Acts 21.8.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he has prov'd, that <hi>Philip</hi> reſided at <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi> as the ſettled <hi>Biſhop</hi> of that Church, and that he was no where elſe all thoſe Years he may talk of a <hi>fixed Evangelist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. May not an unſettled Officer have a ſettled Family? Which he may Viſit at Times? <hi>Paul</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued two Years at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 19.10. a Year and a half at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.11. two Years in his own hired Houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> Acts 28.30. was he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>ſettled or fixed Apoſtle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As much as we have of the Hiſtory of <hi>Philip</hi> beſpeaks him an <hi>unſettled Officer.</hi> We find him in <hi>Samaria,</hi> Acts 8.12. with the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch,</hi> in the way from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto <hi>Gaza,</hi> Acts 8.26. at <hi>Aſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and Preaching in all the Cities, till he came to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> Acts 8.40. which perhaps might be his Birth-place, or he might Marry there, which is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59622:89"/>more likely, becauſe we read of Four Daughters he had, which did Prophecy, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.9. He was an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> before he came to <hi>Caeſarea</hi>

               <p>His other Proof from <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> being fixed or ſettled Evangeliſts, we conſidered before: And it is <hi>Petitio Principii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will add this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All that he ſaith to prove them <hi>fixed Officers</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> depends upon his Suppoſition that the Epiſtles to them were Written after <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt Bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> which I have diſprov'd with reſpect to the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd by all that this Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> were Written about the ſame Time. The Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> was Written, when <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>Macedonia</hi> deſigning to Winter in <hi>Nicopolis, Tit.</hi> 3.12, He Promiſes to ſend <hi>Tychicus</hi> or <hi>Artemas</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Titus,</hi> the former of theſe two was with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and afterwards accompanied him into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> Acts 20.4. Therefore this Epiſtle was Written before <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Impriſonment at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were no <hi>reſident Evangelists</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> for the Apoſtle calls them both away: He calls <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> from <hi>Crete, Tit.</hi> 3.12. which is an evidence he was to make but a ſhort ſtay there, to <hi>ſet in Order the Things that were wanting,</hi> Tit. 1.5. Which when he had done, he muſt attend the Apoſtle, as he had done before: Accordingly he went to <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> and was his Companion and Meſſenger to ſeveral Churches, and at laſt is ſent by him to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> 2 Tim.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59622:89"/>4.10. And we hear no more of him. It cannot be made to appear that ever he return'd more to <hi>Crete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calls <hi>Timothy</hi> away from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9. for the ſame Reaſon that he ſends for <hi>Mark,</hi> both being <hi>profitable to him for the Miniſtry,</hi> having none with him but <hi>Luke, v.</hi> 10, 11. accordingly <hi>Timothy</hi> came to him, and he promiſes to ſend him to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and not to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Phil. 2.19. But it ſhould ſeem he could not go as ſoon as he intended, being made a Priſoner at <hi>Rome:</hi> When he was ſet at Liberty he accompanied the Apoſtle to <hi>Judea,</hi> or deſign'd ſo to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.23.</p>
               <p>From all which it appears, that they were Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts in a proper Sence, that is, extraordinary and unſettled Church-Officers who aſſiſted the Apoſtles in their Miniſtry. and were their Meſſengers to the Churches to eſtabliſh, ſettle and build them up as they had Directions from the Apoſtles, having Power to ordain Elders, and to put forth other Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as occaſion was offer'd. All this is evident from the Powers committed to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> which doubtleſs were the ſame in other Churches, as in <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> for they were Evangeliſts as much in one Place as in another: And the Power of Evangeliſts was the ſame in all Places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This agrees with the account that <hi>Hilarius</hi> gives of <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> who are ſucceeded by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as he thinks; as the <hi>Prophets</hi> are by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by the <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Evangeliſts, ſaith he, did <hi>Evangelize or Preach the Goſpel, ſine Cathedrá,</hi> without a fixed reſidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> quoted <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Plea (<hi>P.</hi> 18.) to the ſame purpoſe, he ſaith of the Evangeliſts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hil.</hi> in 4. Eph.</note> 
                  <q>That they Preached Chriſt to Infidels, ordain'd Paſtors, and paſſed into other Countries and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>It was not the proper Work of Evangeliſts to go up and down Preaching the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, <q>They went far from their Houſes,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59622:90"/>did the Work of Evangeliſts, and diligently Preach'd Chriſt to ſuch as had not as yet heard the Word of Faith, and deliver'd to them the Scriptures of the Holy Goſpels, ordain'd other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and went into other Countries and Nations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have proved out of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, they were unſettled Officers, and therefore it was their proper Work to go up and down Preaching the Goſpel, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirms they did ſo.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith he, <hi>Euſebius writes,</hi> L. 2. Cap. 24. <hi>That</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangeliſt being Dead,</hi> Annianus (ſo he writes it for <hi>Anianus</hi>) <hi>enter'd upon the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Church of</hi> Alexandria; hence he infers, <hi>That</hi> Mark <hi>was a reſident Evangeliſt, not roving up and down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He may as well ſay, that <hi>Peter</hi> was a <hi>reſident Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Linus</hi> ſucceeded him in the Government of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>

               <p>HE Charges <hi>J. O. with reflecting on Epiſcopal Ordination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 122.</note> but gives no Inſtance of any ſuch <hi>Reflection,</hi> which doubtleſs he would have done, if he had been able. Let this paſs among his other Calumnies.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Crambe</hi> about <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> has been conſider'd before:<note place="margin">P. 123.</note> It were endleſs to tire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and my ſelf with nauſeous Repetitions, as often as this Author gives occaſion.</p>
               <p>He falls foully upon <hi>J. O.</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts have no Power of Diſcipline,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 125, 126.</note> which I have proved. They have Power of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe all the Canons, or Laws of the Church, are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59622:93"/>made by the Priests of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as well as by the Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <hi>Executive</hi> Power is the ſame with their <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power, that is, none at all. The Acts of Convocation are no <hi>Laws,</hi> till they be Confirmed in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hath every Pariſh-Prieſt a power of making Church-Laws? If not, this Inſtance is impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in, to prove that the Pariſh-Prieſts have Power of Diſcipline. If it be ſaid they make Laws by their Repreſentatives; ſo do the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by their Repreſentatives in Parliament: Doth it follow therefore, that every Free-holder hath the Power of Governing? Though the Truth is, the Convocation is not a Juſt Repreſentative of the Clergy. For in the Convocation for the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there are but 44 Clerks repreſenting the Clergy; the Biſhops, Deans, Prebendaries and Arch-Deacons, make up 122. The Arch-Deacons, who are the Biſhops Creatures, as being choſen ſolely by them, are 10 in Number more than the Clerks: ſo that the Clerks are little more than Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in Convocation, there are enough in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe to out-vote them, beſides an upper Houſe of Biſhops, who have ſometimes a conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the Election of the very Clerks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Rector may pleaſe himſelf with his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of making new Laws, all the Power we plead for is, a Liberty for Pariſh-Miniſters to execute the Laws of Chriſt, in the excluſion of the Scandalous, and the admiſſion of ſuch as are duly qualify'd for Goſpel-Ordinances.</p>
               <p>The Pariſh-Miniſters, or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as he calls them, (and yet is unreaſonably angry with us for calling them ſo) <hi>have Power to Heprove, and Suſpend for a Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had this before in the Preface. A Private Perſon may Reprove; they can Suſpend from the Lord's Supper for a time, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the next Return of the Carrier, or about 14 Days, and then they are obliged to deliver up all to the Ordinary; with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59622:93"/>whom the Offender often <hi>commutes</hi> for his Crime, and returns as <hi>Impenitent</hi> as he went (except he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> that he has parted with ſo much Money:) When he has made his Peace with the Ordinary, or his Commiſſary, or Chancellor, the Miniſter muſt admit him, or be proceeded againſt himſelf, for diſobeying his Superiours.</p>
               <p>Is their any Preſilent for this in the Goſpel? Did Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, Eſtabliſh this ſort of Diſcipline?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Challenges <hi>J. O. to prove out of Scripture, That ever any Ordinary Presbyters did Excommunicate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 126.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We have but few Inſtances of Excommunication in Scripture; but we have proved already, That the <hi>Corinthian Presbyters,</hi> and conſequently <hi>all others,</hi> had Power to Judge, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>decree Excommunicated,</hi> (as the Rector explains it) thoſe that are within, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Can the Rector, who ſo liberally demands Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Proofs, give us any Inſtance of Preſbyters Suſpending for a <hi>Fortnight?</hi> If he can find no Proof in Scripture, That <hi>ordinary Presbyters did Suſpend at all</hi> from the Communion, how dare they do it <hi>for a Fortnight?</hi> If he finds by Scripture they may Suſpend, how dare he condemn our Preſbyters for Suſpending Perſons until they ſee ſome evidences of their Repentance?</p>
               <p>But ſince he calls for <hi>Proofs,</hi> let him ſhew us ſome Proof out of Scripture for the Power of <hi>Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi> to Excommunicate? or ſome Inſtance of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting Penance</hi> for a Sum of Money. I have read in Scripture of the Prieſts <hi>eating up the ſin of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſetting their Heart on their Iniquity,</hi> Hoſh. 4 8. The Covetous Prieſts then got a ſmall ſhare out of the Sacrifices occaſioned by the <hi>ſins</hi> of the People, <hi>Iev.</hi> 6.26. &amp; 10.17. but our <hi>Commuters</hi> ingroſs the whole Offering to themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is odd to hear a Man call for <hi>Scripture-Proof,</hi> who cannot pretend to any <hi>Scripture-Proof</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of things which they Practice, and Impoſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59622:94"/>as Conditions of Communion on Miniſters and People. Tliis Gentleman has a meaſure and a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that is, a <hi>double meaſure,</hi> one for himſelf and Brethren, and another for the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Were he willing to be determined by the Scripture, as he pretends, our Controverſies would be ſoon at an end.</p>
               <p>He ignorantly affirms,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That the Preſbyterian Biſhops (as he calls them) <hi>are at beſt but the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of the Lay-Elders Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know but very few of the Congregations call'd <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> that have any <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> at all; and thoſe that have, receive them only as <hi>Aſſistants</hi> to the Miniſters, and not as <hi>Rulers Superiour</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Firſt Argument, to prove that Preſbyters may Ordain, is becauſe they are <hi>Scripture-Biſhops. Plea,</hi> p. 12, 13. He proves the Identity of Biſhops and Preſbyters in the New Teſtament times, and ſome Ages after.</p>
               <p>To this Argument the <hi>Rector</hi> anſwers:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He grants <hi>they were the ſame in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 126, 127.</note> 
                  <hi>and were the Ordinary Rulers of the Church, but</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>were above them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing but the brightneſs of Truth could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort ſuch a Confeſſion from him; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Preſbyters and Biſhops were the ſame in the New Teſtament, let him ſhew us who had Power afterwards to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they be the ſame, they have the ſame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Therefore if the Biſhop has Power to Ordain, ſo has the Preſbyter: If the Presbyter has no ſuch Power, no more has the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Thus he has kindly <hi>Eſtabliſhed our Argument;</hi> but I hope his Epiſcopal Friends will not impute it to any <hi>ill deſign</hi> in him, for he is full of good Will to their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and it is their own fault that they have choſen no better an <hi>Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But he hopes to come off, by ſaying that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were above the Preſbyters or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, for hereafter you muſt take them for <hi>one and the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59622:94"/>
                  <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> Evangeliſts, were above the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> What then? It is as natural to infer thence, That Presbyters are above Biſhops, as that Biſhops are above Preſbyters.</p>
               <p>Not only <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> but <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were Superiour to Ordinary Miniſters. But no Example has been yet produced, that one Ordinary Miniſter was Superiour to another Ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. No inſtance can be given in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any one meer Preſbyter that was Superiour to another Preſbyter.</p>
               <p>If there muſt be ſome Church-Officers, called Biſhops, Superiour to Preſbyters, becauſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were ſo; by the ſame reaſon there ought to be ſome Church-Officers Superiour to Biſhops, becauſe the Prophets were Superiour to the Evangeliſts; and another ſort of Church-Officers Superiour to them alſo, becauſe the Apoſtles were Superiour to the Prophets.</p>
               <p>He Subſcribes to <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Aſſertion,<note place="margin">P. 128.</note> That there were <hi>ſeveral Biſhops in one Church in the Apoſtles Days, and that thoſe mention'd in Scripture, were not of our Engliſh Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore by his own Confeſſion, Engliſh Biſhops are not Scripture-Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there was an Order of Church-Officers above theſe Presbyter-Biſhops,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as we have demonſtrated in the Churches of</hi> Crete <hi>and</hi> Epheſus.</p>
               <p>There were no leſs than three Orders above them, that is, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> each of them extraordinary Church-Officers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. deſign'd for the Planting of the Chriſtian Church, as the ordinary Paſtora and Teachers were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the propagating of it unto the end of Time.</p>
               <p>The Foundations were to be laid by thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Church-Officers, the Superſtructure to be carried on, according to the Platform they left us, by ordinary Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> Prov'd out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac Verſion</hi> of the New Teſtament, That Biſhop and Preſbyter were the ſame in the Ages after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

                  <hi>P.</hi> 13, 14. This the Rector prudently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks.</p>
               <p>He thus Paraphraſeth on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>They who Rule well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 129.</note> 
                  <hi>and alſo labour in the Word and Doctrine, deſerve better than they only who Rule well, but don't withal labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here he ſuppoſes that ſome in the Church may Rule well, who don't Labour in the Word and Doctrine: But <hi>who are theſe?</hi> He will not ſay <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> for then the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who Rules well, and Labours in the Word and Doctrine, is worthy of more Honour than the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> that he will not like: There remains no other but the Preſbyterians <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elder,</hi> whom he vindicates by his kind Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.

               <p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It hence follows they were <hi>real Biſhops,</hi> as he has confeſſed; and if Ordination be a Branch of Epiſcopal Power, as he ſaith it is, theſe Elders had Power to Ordain.</p>

What can the Rector ſay to this? Matter of Fact is ſo plain that he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and therefore endeavours to palliate it as well as he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> ſays he, <hi>in this very Book has made uſe of the Popiſh School-Men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 131.</note> p. 55. 107. and therefore <hi>I cannot avoid taxing him with great Inſincerity and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector's Invention runs low, that he can find nothing but the old, dull, thred-bare charge of <hi>Inſincerity,</hi> which we have had over and over. But the comfort of it is, his Tongue is no Slander. All the difference between <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Arguments out of the Popiſh Doctors, and Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Arguments out of them is this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He treads in their Steps without once naming them; <hi>J. O.</hi> names them all along, when he makes uſe of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>J. O.</hi> Quotes the Popiſh Doctors, againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and for the Reformed Churches, who moſt of them have no Biſhops; and all will allow, that the <hi>Teſtimony of an Adverſary is good against himſelf:</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> improves their Arguments againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, whom <hi>they</hi> and <hi>he</hi> condemn as no Churches, for want of Ordaining Biſhops. The Rector is too cunning to deliver thc Concluſion in expreſs Words, but he lays down, and endeavours to eſtabliſh thoſe Premiſſes, that neceſſarily infer this concluſion, That Popiſh Ordinations are valid, and, that all the Ordinations of the Reformed Churches (except thoſe in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by Biſhops) are a Nullity. This is the deſign of his Book, in which he pretends to prove, That no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Presbyter hath Power to Ordain,</hi> and that no <hi>Inſtance can be given in all the New Teſtament of any Ordaining Presbyter;</hi> and that Biſhops <hi>are Superiour to Presbyters by a Divine Right.</hi> The Truth is, the Performance is as <hi>weak,</hi> as the Undertaking is <hi>bold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I leave it to the Reader to Judge, who is to be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59622:96"/>charged with <hi>Inſincerity,</hi> one that Defends the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches againſt the Popiſh Writers, tho' he quotes them ſometimes againſt themſelves; or one who under the Name of a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> joyns with the Popiſh Church and Doctors, in deſtroying the Miniſtry of the greateſt part of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.</hi>

                  <hi>one thing he will be bold to tell</hi> J. O. <hi>that he will here meet with an Argument borrowed from Biſhop</hi> Pearſon, <hi>which he thinks neither any Papiſt, nor</hi> J. O. <hi>himſelf ever thought of before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who <hi>ſo bold as blind</hi> Bayard? This Man bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, That no <hi>Papiſt</hi> ever thought of Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi>'s Argument, drawn from the time of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhewed before that the <hi>Seminary</hi> at <hi>Rhemes</hi> thought of the Biſhop's Argument before he was born.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> has a great many Qualities that are very ſingular, this among others, That when he is remoteſt from Truth, he is then moſt confident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He thinks</hi> J. O. <hi>never thought of this Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> His <hi>Memory</hi> is as defective as his <hi>Reading.</hi> J.

Some Gentlemen that were then preſent, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Memory, if need he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> Argued, that thoſe Words, <hi>Lay hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on no Man,</hi> do not prove the ſole Power of Ordination in <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, <hi>It ought to be hence concluded, that the ſole Power of Ordination was in</hi> Timothy,<note place="margin">P. 133.</note> 
                  <hi>till</hi> J. O. <hi>can produce a like Commiſſion given to the Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That has been proved from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>J. O</hi>'s. <hi>Reaſon is a very pleaſant one, it may as well follow</hi> (ſaith <hi>J. O.</hi>) <hi>that the ſole Power of Teaching belongs to him, becauſe the Apoſtle hids him be instant in Preaching the Word. By no means,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59622:97"/>ſaith Mr. <hi>G. becauſe the Apoſtle directs him expreſly to appoint other Teachers.</hi> 2 Tim. 22. <hi>We deſire to ſee ſome like Paſſages of other Ordainers, beſide</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, or rather the Holy Ghoſt, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Biſhops in <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20.28. If the Power of Ordination belongs to Biſhops as ſuch, theſe <hi>Epheſian</hi> Biſhops were Ordainers. It is an old, and a true Maxim, <hi>Quatenus ad omne valet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentia.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. But leſt we ſhould want other Ordainers, he'l furniſh us with ſome from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. which tho' his Argument inclines him to underſtand it of Teachers at preſent, yet in another Mood he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it of Ordainers, <hi>p.</hi> 53.</p>

               <p>The Rector Anſwers, <hi>The Miſchief is,</hi> Barnabas <hi>was</hi> Paul<hi>'s equal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and an Apoſtle as well as himſelf,</hi> Acts 14.4.14.</p>
               <p>Many think <hi>Barnabas</hi> was not <hi>Paul</hi>'s equal; that he was properly an Evangeliſt<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Sad. ad Tur. Soph. <hi>p. 783.</hi>
                  </note>. Evangeliſts were Secondary Apoſtles, <hi>Apostoli vicarii,</hi> as ſome call them. They ſeem to be included in Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. compar'd with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he is call'd an <hi>Apoſtle, Acts</hi> 14.4, 14. ſo are others, who were not Apoſtles in a ſtrict Senſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25.</p>

               </p>

                  <hi>when he talks of other ordinary Presbyters Ordaining with theſe two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. I deſire to ſee this made out by any tolerable Conjecture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>J. O.</hi> did not affirm that Preſbyters Ordain'd with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 14.23. becauſe it is uncertain whether there were any in theſe Churches before this time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if there were any, 'tis probable they join'd in the action, as they did in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. which may ground a probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul's intention to go to</hi> Epheſus,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. &amp; 4.13. <hi>hinders not</hi> Timothy <hi>from being the Reſident Biſhop there, as he thinks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. His intention of going ſhortly to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſhews the inconſiſtency of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Hypotheſis; for he told us before (<hi>p.</hi> 90.) <hi>That the Apoſtle Govern'd the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>himſelf by the Presbyters in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> who were reſponſible to him. <hi>This continued ſo long,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as he was vigorous and active, and had opportunity to over-ſee both the Flock and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themſelves.</hi> And now he tells us, That this Church was Govern'd by a Biſhop, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was both able and reſolved to overſee it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He told us before that the Presbyters <hi>were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible to</hi> Paul, and now he makes <hi>Timothy reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to him. Nothing can be inferr'd from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to <hi>Paul,</hi> that does not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> equally affect <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>Paul</hi>'s going to <hi>Timothy</hi> does not hinder his being Reſident at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> I hope <hi>Timothy</hi>'s going to <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.21. Except the Rector can prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> had an <hi>ubiquitarian</hi> Body. If he ſaith he return'd again in a little time to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59622:98"/>he ought to prove it; which he can never do from the Writings of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>He chargeth <hi>J. O.</hi> with foiſting the Words <hi>till he came,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> into 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. This Charge is as groundleſs as it is diſingenuous; for <hi>J. O.</hi> did not quote thc Words of Scripture, but gave the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in theſe Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> did not injoyn <hi>Timothy</hi> to be reſident at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but beſought him to abide there till he came, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. &amp; 4.13, 14. which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhortly to do, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Joyning of the Scriptures together, and the Explaining of one Scripture by another, will be allow'd by any one that does not ſeek occaſions of quarrelling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Till I come,</hi> beſpeaks a Temporary Stay at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> for he was beſought by <hi>Paul</hi> to ſupply his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there; when the Apoſtle came in Perſon, there was no need of a <hi>Subſtitute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> went from <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> or whether <hi>Paul</hi> went from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it's one and the ſame thing, his Work there was <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,</hi> and became unneceſſary, when the Apoſtle was with him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſent him not long before this to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and ſometime after follow'd him thither, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.21, 22. In like manner he deſign'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p>The Rector takes for granted what he ſhould have prov'd, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was obliged to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reſidence at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which has not been yet proved.

Doubtleſs he went thither, according to the Apoſtle's Order, and we find him there with the Apoſtle, when he wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Philem.</hi> 1. In like manner he ſends for <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Crete</hi> to <hi>Nicopolis, Tit.</hi> 3.12, and afterwards ſends him to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p>Thus we have told him, in compliance with his deſires, out of <hi>Sacred Hiſtory,</hi> That not only <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> but <hi>Titus</hi> alſo, removed, the former to <hi>Rome,</hi> the latter to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>

               <p>I do not pretend to warrant for the Truth of this Account. There may be ſome Truths, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd with Fables, even in a Legend. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vſher,</hi> that great Antiquary, quotes this Story, in his <hi>Britan. Eccleſ. Primord. Cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>It may not be improbable but <hi>Timothy</hi> might Preach in theſe Countries, if <hi>Paul</hi> was here, as the Rector ſeems to allow, <hi>p.</hi> 90. For <hi>Timothy</hi> was his Companion in moſt of his Travels, and <hi>Served with him in the Goſpel, as a Son with the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>The Rector has two or three Pages in Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Whittaker,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 135, 136, 137, 138.</note> the Sum of which is, That if <hi>Timothy was only to acquaint the Church with it, he was no better than an Informer, or Proſecutor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He might be an Eccleſiaſtical Judge, though he acted in Conjunction with the Church, as <hi>Paul</hi> did in Excommunicating the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. The Doctor doth not deny
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59622:99"/>him to be Superiour to the Elders, as he was an Evangeliſt, but ſhews the invalidity of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from his <hi>receiving Accuſations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> ſhew'd (<hi>p.</hi> 21.) that the Preſbyters and the People may receive an Accuſation againſt their Biſhop, and Inſtanced in <hi>Epithetus,</hi> and the People of <hi>Aſſura,</hi> to whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes not to admit <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatianus</hi> to be Biſhop again, becauſe he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Faith. He inſtanceth alſo in the Clergy and People of <hi>Spain,</hi> who rejected <hi>Biſilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi> their Biſhops, becauſe they had Sacrificed to Idols.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> wiſely over-looks all this, and proceeds to another Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> Aſks how comes <hi>Paul</hi> to promiſe to come ſhortly to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> if he had ſettled a Succeſſor there?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Anſwers, this is a <hi>trifling Objection, and makes equally against the Presbyters of Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>Who ever thought</hi> Timothy <hi>ſo abſolute, as not to be ſubject to St.</hi> Paul?</p>
               <p>When this Gentleman gives a diminutive Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet to our Arguments, underſtand him by the Rule of Contraries. You may perceive by his Uneaſineſs that he is Gravell'd, and would relieve himſelf by a big Word, which may diſparage an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with unthinking People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>trifling Objection,</hi> as he calls it, ſhews how groundleſs his Hypotheſis is, That <hi>Paul</hi> ſettled <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he could over-ſee the Church no longer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhews the weakneſs of his Reaſonings, That the Elders had no Epiſcopal Power, becauſe they were ſubject to the Apoſtles. The Scope of a great part of his Book, is to prove that the Preſbyters were not Supream Governours, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were above them. See <hi>P.</hi> 38, 39, 40, 41. He does in the ſame place affirm, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be Supream Governours. Here he forgets all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59622:100"/>his former Reaſonings, and acknowledges <hi>Timothy</hi> Subject to <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either <hi>Timothy</hi> was no Supreme Governour or Biſhop, becauſe he was Subject to <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Preſbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> might be <hi>Supream Governours,</hi> notwithſtanding their Subjection to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What he adds, <hi>of his viſiting his Neighbour Presbyter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 139.</note> 
                  <hi>without claiming any Power over him and his Flock,</hi> is very impertinent; for an <hi>Apostolical Viſitation,</hi> was ſomething different from a private Viſit from one Neighbour to another.</p>
               <p>I hope he will allow it to be as Solemn as any <hi>Epiſcopal Viſitation.</hi> I might return his own Words upon him, <hi>But ſuch Stuff as this does our Author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon his Friends,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and needleſsly troubles his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with,</hi> but I ſhall forbear.</p>
               <p>He thinks that the <hi>Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>conſiſted of many Congregations,</hi> though he agree that it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not of two hundred or three hundred Pariſhes or Congregations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>as our Dioceſſes do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have his own Confeſſion, That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Dioceſſes are very different from that of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and other Ancient Dioceſſes.</p>
               <p>That there were more Congregations than one, he proves from the <hi>Jus Divinum Miniſterii Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 140.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe there were two or three Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters conceive there might be more than one, what is two or three, to two or three hundred? It can never be prov'd, there were more Chriſtians in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s, or if you will in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, than are in ſome of our great Pariſhes, which contains ſome <hi>Ten,</hi> ſome <hi>Twenty,</hi> ſome <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of our larger Pariſhes have ſeveral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, ſome three, ſome four, ſome ſix: He knows a Pariſh in his Neighbourhood<note n="*" place="margin">Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> that has Seven or Eight: Will he ſay that a <hi>Rector,</hi> who has ſeveral Curates under him, is a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59622:100"/>I hear the Rector's Pariſh has four or five Chapels in it.</p>
               <p>He thinks the <hi>number of Cities,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 142.</note> 
                  <hi>or great Towns in</hi> Crete <hi>was extraordinary, becauſe</hi> Florus <hi>calls it a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iſland.</hi> His Proof is a little <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Muſt every Noble Iſland have an extraordinary number of Cities?</p>
               <p>Well, but to do him a kindneſs, I will tell him the number of the moſt conſiderable Cities or Towns in <hi>Crete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny,</hi> who lived in <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s time, ſaith there were about Fourty Famous Towns in <hi>Crete,</hi> and the Memory of about Fourty more<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nat. Hiſt.</hi> 4.12.</note>. But let the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it be more or leſs, it is all one to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: We have proved <hi>Titus</hi> already to be an Evangeliſt, and the number of Cities he was to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders in is a Confirmation of it. For by his own Confeſſion, <hi>Crete</hi> has had in it, at one time, Four Arch-Biſhops, and Twenty one Biſhops<note n="†" place="margin">P. 142.</note>. And now we are upon this Subject, let's ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Biſhopricks. He tells us out of Dr. <hi>Heylin, There were</hi> 207 <hi>Pariſhes in</hi> Crete; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between twenty five Biſhops, there falls but Eight Pariſhes to the ſhare of each Biſhop, and an over-plus of 7/25 Parts.</p>
               <p>How different were theſe from Modern Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks? A Biſhop may better Over-ſee Eight or Nine Pariſhes, than Eight or Nine Scores of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> Proved that the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of no more Members than could ordinarily meet in one place, becauſe that Church had but <hi>one Altar.</hi> at which the whole Congregation ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Receiv'd the Lord's Supper, in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Anſwers, That <hi>Ignatius's one Altar, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not one Numerical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 143.</note> 
                  <hi>but one Specifical Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s one Biſhop, muſt ſignifie not one Numerical, but one <hi>Specifical</hi> Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59622:101"/>He thinks <hi>there was more than one Numerical Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, becauſe after the Words Alledged by</hi> J. O. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>goes on thus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Let that Eucharist be accounted good and firm, which is Celebrated under the Biſhop, or which he conſents to.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Biſhop,</hi> is plainly in his preſence (and <hi>not under his Authority,</hi> as he explains it) as being oppoſed to his Conſent in his abſence.</p>
               <p>His conſenting that the Preſbyters might Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in his abſence, doth not prove more than one Altar. The Parſon of one Pariſh (which hath but one Altar) may conſent that his Curates may Adminiſter the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>He further proves there were many Altars under <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Biſhop, from that Paſſage — <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Biſhop appears, there let the People be, even as where Jeſus Chriſt is,</hi> (not <hi>appears,</hi> as he falſly renders <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) <hi>there is the Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing could have been produced more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently than this Paſſage, which ſhews that the Multitude muſt be where the Biſhop was, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; his Appearance muſt be underſtood of his <hi>perſonal, viſible Appearance.</hi> To talk of an Inviſible Appearance is ridiculous.</p>
               <p>And yet you muſt underſtand it ſo, ſaith our Author; <hi>It is not to be underſtood of his Perſon,</hi> but Authority, ſaith he, even <hi>as Jeſus Christ is with the Catholick Church, not in his Perſon, but in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This is worſe and worſe; <hi>Ignatius</hi> did not ſay, Where Chriſt appears, as he to ſerve a Deſign fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly renders <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To deny Chriſt to be perſonally preſent with his Church, is to deny him to be the Second Perſon in the Trinity. I hope he believes the Divinity and Omnipreſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59622:101"/>in a Tranſport of Zeal he forgot the Form of Sound Words. The Spiritual Power of Chriſt doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Perſonal Preſence.</p>

               </p>
               <p>They expreſſed their own Senſe, and that of the Ancient Church. They could eaſily have call'd the Angels <hi>Biſhops,</hi> had they thought them ſo.

               <p>After having ſpent ſome Pages in ſuch Scornful Reflections as may become him, but would ſcarce drop from a Scholar, or a Gentleman, eſpecially when no Provocation is given, he proceeds to an Ingenuous Confeſſion of the weakneſs of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Biſhops from the <hi>Aſian</hi> Angels.</p>
               <p>It would have been a <hi>ſtrange Conſequence,</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that Angels ſhould be expounded Biſhop, one that had Authority over other Miniſters, <hi>had not he read in</hi> Paul<hi>'s</hi> Two Epiſtles, <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>had Authority over the whole Church of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and again in</hi> Ignatius,<note place="margin">P. 160.</note>

               <p>Our Author is very angry with <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>This plain Scripture-Obſervation, doth ſo move the Rector's Choler, that he cannot forbear his old Railing Language. <hi>If</hi> J.

                  </gap>, and ſo the Angels being round about the Throne, and round about the Elders, it follows the Elders were nearer the Throne. Why doth not he diſprove this Senſe? A Scholar ſhould uſe Arguments, and not <hi>Bilingſgate</hi>-Dialect.</p>

               <p>Where then is the <hi>diſhoneſty</hi> and <hi>inſincerity</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this Argument? Is it in ſaying, That the Inference is more natural, that Preſbyters are more Honourable than Biſhops, if Angels be Biſhops? Why does he not diſprove this Inference? <hi>J.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59622:106"/>of Chriſt than Elders, Elders are more Honourable than Biſhops.</p>
               <p>So then <hi>J. O.</hi> has managed this Argument <hi>honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely,</hi> for any thing the Rector hath ſaid to the contrary.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Timothy, There was no Man like-minded,</hi> Phil. 2.20, 22.

               <p>So are the Preſbyters to Jeſus Chriſt, our great High-Prieſt, and to all Rulers of his appointment.

               <p>When it is againſt the Truth we reject it; when there is a Harmony between it, and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, we receive it not for <hi>Confirmation</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, but for <hi>Illuſtration.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Miniſter of every Synagogue was <hi>call'd the Angel of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath prov'd: Therefore it looks highly rational that the <hi>Angels of the</hi> Aſian <hi>Churches</hi> ſhould be ſo called, in Alluſion to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Synagogue. Chriſtian Oratories are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59622:107"/>call'd Synagogues, <hi>James</hi> 2.2. Our Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the Agreement in many things between both: But, ſays he, <hi>The Temple-Worſhip, whereof a great deal was Moral, was as much the Pattern of the Chriſtian, as was the Synagogue-Worſhip:</hi> and if ſo, <hi>the Jewiſh Prieſt-hood was the Pattern of the Chriſtian Hierarchy,</hi> p. 166.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Jewiſh Prieſthood was appropriated to the Ceremonial Worſhip of the Temple, though they perform'd the Moral parts there alſo. The Legal Prieſts, and the Legal Altar, were <hi>Relates, Heb.</hi> 7.13, 14. and both were Aboliſhed together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. <hi>For the Priesthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law.</hi> What Law? not that which concern'd the Moral Worſhip, but the Law of Ceremonies, to which the Levitical Prieſthood was adapted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Moral Worſhip</hi> in the Synagogues might be performed by ſuch as were no Prieſts<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lightf.</hi> Vol. II. p. 133, 134, 135.</note>, but none but Prieſts gave attendance at the Altar, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.13. Therefore the Ceremonial Worſhip, Temple, and Prieſthood, being Aboliſhed, and the Moral Worſhip (which was the only Synagogue-Worſhip) being Tranſplanted into the Chriſtian Church, it follows that the <hi>Jewiſh Priesthood</hi> was no Pattern of the Goſpel-Miniſtry. But this has been conſider'd before.</p>

                  <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Firſt Inſtance of Ordination by Preſbyters, from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. hath been ſufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated above, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>He might as well have affirm'd,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias, <hi>another of the Seventy, was but a Presbyter, who ſucceeded</hi> Judas.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Matthias</hi> his Solemn Call to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, and that he was Numbred with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.26. but we have not the like account of <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, he is call'd an Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.4.14. ſo are Evangeliſts ſometimes, as we proved before.

               <p>He affirms, but cannot prove, That the <hi>Apoſtles reſerved Ordination to themſelves.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 175.</note> We have prov'd the contrary already. He aſks <hi>with what Effrontery dares</hi> J. O, <hi>call</hi> Peter Lombard <hi>to his Aſſistance,</hi>

               <p>I have Anſwered this already. In ſhort, the Teſtimony of an Adverſary is Valid againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>He acknowledges, That <hi>if the Ordaining Power, did by Scripture-Charter belong to the Presbyters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 176.</note> 
                  <hi>then to pretend to deprive 'em of it were a Nullity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have proved that it does belong to them by Scripture-Charter: And therefore his Inſtance of a Preſbyter Baptizing a Believer, who hath no Power to Baptize another, is not to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>He has often profeſs'd, That he will not trace <hi>J.

               <p>He makes a long ſtride from <hi>p.</hi> 58. of <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Plea,<note place="margin">P. 177, 188.</note> to <hi>p.</hi> 179. and there he picks quarrel with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59622:109"/>two Quotations of his, which ſhew the Preſbyters to Succeed the Apoſtles as much as the Biſhops. He ſkips over but 120 Pages of <hi>J. O</hi>'s. Book, and yet would perſuade the World he has Anſwer'd it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I had done ſo by his Book, (which I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in all that's material, Paragraph by Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph) would not ſome People be tempted to think it unanſwerable, and that I undertook what I was not able to perform.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Presbyters Succeeded in the place of the Bench of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There's nothing more unfair,</hi> ſaith my Author,<note place="margin">P. 178.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>J. O.</hi> only Quoted the Words, without Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how then could he miſrepreſent the meaning?</p>
               <p>But the meaning is, as he tells us, <hi>That the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are the Biſhops Seconds, as the Apostles were Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt's Seconds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Rector</hi> wants a <hi>Second</hi> to explain his Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is ſo obſcure and unintelligible.</p>
               <p>I hope he would not make <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſay, that the Biſhops are as much the Head of the Preſbyters, as Chriſt is of the Apoſtles. But let's hear <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf. <hi>I exhort you,</hi> ſaith he,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>do all your Works in the Concord of God, the Biſhops preſiding in the place of God, and the Presbyters in the place of the Bench (or Council) of the Apostles, and the Deacons, who are precious to me, to whom is committed the Miniſtry of Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in another place: <hi>Let all of you follow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as Jeſus Chriſt followed the Father, and follow the Presbytery as the Apoſtles, and reverence the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons as the Command of God</hi>

               <p>In another place, <hi>Reverence the Deacons, as the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Biſhop as Jeſus

               <p>I leave it to the Impartial Reader's Judgment, whether all theſe Expreſſions put together, do not make it plain, That the Preſbyters according to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Succeed the Apoſtles. Can any thing be expreſs'd with more clearneſs? They preſide in the place of the Bench of the Apoſtles. They muſt be followed as the Apoſtles, reverenc'd as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Apoſtles, and as the Orders of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>

               </p>
               <p>See the Candor of this Gentleman, he declines <hi>J. O</hi>'s Teſtimonies out of Antiquity, and yet turns over above a Hundred Pages, to ſearch out one or two Quotations that he may Cavil at them.</p>

                  <hi>that this place may be underſtood not of Biſhops, but of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Presbyters; but</hi> Irenaeus <hi>by Presbyters means Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>J. O.</hi> ſpoke of Presbyters (not: Preſbyteries) Succeeding the Apoſtles; and quoted <hi>Irenaeus</hi> for Proof. He does not uſe the Word Preſbytery in all that Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 179, 180.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> cannot deny but <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Succeeded the Apoſtles,</hi> but he thinks by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters he means Biſhops.</hi> We think ſo too, and thence infer, That Preſbyters and Biſhops are the ſame in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as they are in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>He ſaith in another place, <hi>We must obey thoſe Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters that are in the Church, who received their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apostles</hi> (as we have ſhewn) <hi>who with the Succeſſion of their Epiſcopacy, have received the certain Grace of Truth, according to the Father's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Such Presbyters the Church nouriſheth, of whom the Prophet ſaith,</hi> I will give thee Rulers in Peace, and Biſhops in Righteouſneſs<note n="‖" place="margin">

               <p>Obſerve here, 1. That Preſbyters Succeed the Apoſtles. 2. Preſbyters have an Epiſcopacy. 3. Thoſe whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls Preſbyters, he calls alſo Biſhops. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Biſhop was but the firſt Preſbyter, as <hi>Hilarius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Deacon calls him<note n="*" place="margin">Int. ad.

               <p>By thoſe firſt Preſbyters (who for Order ſake, had the precedency of the reſt) <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and others, derive the Succeſſion. But the Churches were Governed not by thoſe ſingle Preſbyters, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59622:111"/>alone, but by the <hi>College of Presbyters in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> among whom the Senior Preſbyter, or the moſt worthy, had the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As the <hi>Athenians</hi> reckon'd the Years in which the <hi>Archontes</hi> Govern'd their Republic, by the firſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon,</hi> though there were <hi>Nine</hi> of them in all; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> denominated the Years of their <hi>Ephori</hi> (who were Five in all) by the Name of the Firſt<note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

                  </note>; ſo the Fathers derive the Succeſſion of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, by the Firſt and Chief Preſbyter, to whom the Name of Biſhop, by degrees, was appropriated.</p>
               <p>Thus we have Vindicated <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> againſt the angry Exceptions of our Author. I will add one or two more, but with no deſign to ſtir up his Choler.</p>

The Argument is ours, to prove that Preſbyters ſucceed the Apoſtles, (who Stile themſelves Preſbyters) in the ordinary part of their Office.
